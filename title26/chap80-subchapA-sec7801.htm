<h4 class="note-head">National Commission on Restructuring Internal Revenue Service</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 104&ndash;52, title VI, &sect;637, Nov. 19, 1995, 109 Stat. 509, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) While the budget for the Internal Revenue Service (hereafter referred to as the &lsquo;IRS&rsquo;) has risen from $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1979 to $7.3 billion in fiscal year 1996, tax returns processing has not become significantly faster, tax collection rates have not significantly increased, and the accuracy and timeliness of taxpayer assistance has not significantly improved.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To date, the Tax Systems Modernization (TSM) program has cost the taxpayers $2.5 billion, with an estimated cost of $8 billion. Despite this investment, modernization efforts were recently described by the GAO as &lsquo;chaotic&rsquo; and &lsquo;ad hoc&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) While the IRS maintains that TSM will increase efficiency and thus revenues, Congress has had to appropriate additional funds in recent years for compliance initiatives in order to increase tax revenues.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Because TSM has not been implemented, the IRS continues to rely on paper returns, processing a total of 14 billion pieces of paper every tax season. This results in an extremely inefficient system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) This lack of efficiency reduces the level of customer service and impedes the ability of the IRS to collect revenue.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The present status of the IRS shows the need for the establishment of a Commission which will examine the organization of IRS and recommend actions to expedite the implementation of TSM and improve service to taxpayers.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Composition of the Commission.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the purposes of this section, there is established a National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service (in this section referred to as the &lsquo;Commission&rsquo;).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2787 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Composition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall be composed of thirteen members, as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Five members appointed by the President, two from the executive branch of the Government, two from private life, and one from an organization that represents a substantial number of Internal Revenue Service employees.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Two members appointed by the Majority Leader of the Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private life.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private life.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, one from Members of the House of Representatives and one from private life.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, one from Members of the House of Representatives and one from private life.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service shall be an ex officio member of the Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Chairman</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall elect a Chairman from among its members.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) <cap-smallcap>Meeting; quorum; vacancies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After its initial meeting, the Commission shall meet upon the call of the Chairman or a majority of its members. Seven members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum. Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect its powers, but shall be filled in the same manner in which the original appointment was made.</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) <cap-smallcap>Appointment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of the Congress that members of the Committee [Commission] should be appointed not more than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this section [Nov. 19, 1995].</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) <cap-smallcap>Initial meeting</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after 60 days from the date of the enactment of this section, seven or more members of the Commission have been appointed, members who have been appointed may meet and select a Chairman who thereafter shall have the authority to begin the operations of the Commission, including the hiring of staff.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Functions of Commission.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The functions of the Commission shall be&mdash;</p>

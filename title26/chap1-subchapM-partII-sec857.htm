<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this part (other than subsection (d) of this section and subsection (g) of section 856) shall not apply to a real estate investment trust for a taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in section 561, but determined without regard to capital gains dividends) equals or exceeds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 95 percent (90 percent for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980) of the real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) and by excluding any net capital gain); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 95 percent (90 percent for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980) of <!-- PDFPage:1331 -->the excess of the net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by subsection (b)(4)(A); minus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any excess noncash income (as determined under subsection (e)); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the real estate investment trust complies for such year with regulations prescribed by the Secretary for the purpose of ascertaining the actual ownership of the outstanding shares, or certificates of beneficial interest, of such trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the provisions of this part apply to the real estate investment trust for all taxable years beginning after February 28, 1986, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as of the close of the taxable year, the real estate investment trust has no earnings and profits accumulated in any non-REIT year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;non-REIT year&rdquo; means any taxable year to which the provisions of this part did not apply with respect to the entity. The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) for any taxable year if the real estate investment trust establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it was unable to meet such requirements by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of section 4981.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of taxation of real estate investment trusts and holders of shares or certificates of beneficial interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of tax on real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the real estate investment trust taxable income of every real estate investment trust a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the real estate investment trust taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Real estate investment trust taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;real estate investment trust taxable income&rdquo; means the taxable income of the real estate investment trust, adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to that portion of such deduction which is attributable to the amount excluded under subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) There shall be excluded an amount equal to the net income from foreclosure property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) There shall be deducted an amount equal to the tax imposed by paragraph (5) for the taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) There shall be excluded an amount equal to any net income derived from prohibited transactions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Capital gains</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Alternative tax in case of capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If for any taxable year a real estate investment trust has a net capital gain, then, in lieu of the tax imposed by subsection (b)(1), there is hereby imposed a tax (if such tax is less than the tax imposed by such subsection) which shall consist of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a tax, computed as provided in subsection (b)(1), on the real estate investment trust taxable income (determined by excluding such net capital gain and by computing the deduction for dividends paid without regard to capital gain dividends), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a tax determined at the rate provided in section 1201(a) on the excess of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gains dividends only.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders or holders of beneficial interests as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is designated by the real estate investment trust as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests at any time before the expiration of 30 days after the close of its taxable year (or mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests with its annual report for the taxable year); except that, if there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph for such year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), such designation may be made with respect to such increase at any time before the expiration of 120 days after the date of such determination. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the trust (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 858) is greater than the net capital gain of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such net capital gain bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount of the net capital gain for any taxable year which is not a calendar year shall be determined without regard to any net capital loss attributable to transactions after December 31 of such year, and any such net capital loss shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the next taxable year. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall apply also for purposes of computing the taxable income of the real estate investment trust.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1332 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Coordination with net operating loss provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 172, if a real estate investment trust pays capital gain dividends during any taxable year, the amount of the net capital gain for such taxable year (to the extent such gain does not exceed the amount of such capital gain dividends) shall be excluded in determining&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the net operating loss for the taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of the net operating loss of any prior taxable year which may be carried through such taxable year under section 172(b)(2) to a succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Income from foreclosure property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the net income from foreclosure property of every real estate investment trust. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying the net income from foreclosure property by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Net income from foreclosure property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;net income from foreclosure property&rdquo; means the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) gain from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property described in section 1221(1) and the gross income for the taxable year derived from foreclosure property (as defined in section 856(e)), but only to the extent such gross income is not described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (G) of section 856(c)(3), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the income referred to in clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Imposition of tax in case of failure to meet certain requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If section 856(c)(7) applies to a real estate investment trust for any taxable year, there is hereby imposed on such trust a tax in an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 95 percent (90 percent in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980) of the gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) of the real estate investment trust, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of such gross income which is derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(2); or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 75 percent of the gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) of the real estate investment trust, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of such gross income which is derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(3),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year (determined without regard to the deductions provided in paragraphs (2)(B) and (2)(E), without regard to any net operating loss deduction, and by excluding any net capital gain) and the denominator of which is the gross income for the taxable year (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions; gross income and gain from foreclosure property (as defined in section 856(e), but only to the extent such gross income and gain is not described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (G) of section 856(c)(3)); long-term capital gain; and short-term capital gain to the extent of any short-term capital loss).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Income from prohibited transactions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year of every real estate investment trust a tax equal to 100 percent of the net income derived from prohibited transactions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the term &ldquo;net income derived from prohibited transactions&rdquo; means the excess of the gain from prohibited transactions over the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with prohibited transactions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in determining the amount of the net income derived from prohibited transactions, there shall not be taken into account any item attributable to any prohibited transaction for which there was a loss; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the term &ldquo;prohibited transaction&rdquo; means a sale or other disposition of property described in section 1221(1) which is not foreclosure property.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain sales not to constitute prohibited transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;prohibited transaction&rdquo; does not include a sale of property which is a real estate asset as defined in section 856(c)(6)(B) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the trust has held the property for not less than 4 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) aggregate expenditures made by the trust, or any partner of the trust, during the 4-year period preceding the date of sale which are includible in the basis of the property do not exceed 30 percent of the net selling price of the property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii)(I) during the taxable year the trust does not make more than 7 sales of property (other than foreclosure property), or (II) the aggregate adjusted bases (as determined for purposes of computing earnings and profits) of property (other than foreclosure property) sold during the taxable year does not exceed 10 percent of the aggregate bases (as so determined) of all of the assets of the trust as of the beginning of the taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) in the case of property, which consists of land or improvements, not acquired through foreclosure (or deed in lieu of foreclosure), or lease termination, the trust has held the property for not less than 4 years for production of rental income; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1333 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) if the requirement of clause (iii)(I) is not satisfied, substantially all of the marketing and development expenditures with respect to the property were made through an independent contractor (as defined in section 856(d)(3)) from whom the trust itself does not derive or receive any income.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying subparagraph (C) the following special rules apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The holding period of property acquired through foreclosure (or deed in lieu of foreclosure), or termination of the lease, includes the period for which the trust held the loan which such property secured, or the lease of such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) In the case of a property acquired through foreclosure (or deed in lieu of foreclosure), or termination of a lease, expenditures made by, or for the account of, the mortgagor or lessee after default became imminent will be regarded as made by the trust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Expenditures (including expenditures regarded as made directly by the trust, or indirectly by any partner of the trust, under clause (ii)) will not be taken into account if they relate to foreclosure property and did not cause the property to lose its status as foreclosure property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Expenditures will not be taken into account if they are made solely to comply with standards or requirements of any government or governmental authority having relevant jurisdiction, or if they are made to restore the property as a result of losses arising from fire, storm or other casualty.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Sales not meeting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining whether or not any sale constitutes a &ldquo;prohibited transaction&rdquo; for purposes of subparagraph (A), the fact that such sale does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph shall not be taken into account; and such determination, in the case of a sale not meeting such requirements, shall be made as if subparagraphs (C) and (D) had not been enacted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Loss on sale or exchange of stock held 6 months or less</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) provides that any amount with respect to any share or beneficial interest is to be treated as a long-term capital gain, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the taxpayer has held such share or interest for 6 months or less,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then any loss on the sale or exchange of such share or interest shall, to the extent of the amount described in clause (i), be treated as a long-term capital loss.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination of holding period</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to have been paid by such trust on December 31 of such calendar year (or, if earlier, as provided in section 858).</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restrictions applicable to dividends received from real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of section 243 (relating to deductions for dividends received by corporations), a dividend received from a real estate investment trust which meets the requirements of this part shall not be considered as a dividend.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Earnings and profits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The earnings and profits of a real estate investment trust for any taxable year (but not its accumulated earnings) shall not be reduced by any amount which is not allowable in computing its taxable income for such taxable year. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;real estate investment trust&rdquo; includes a domestic corporation, trust, or association which is a real estate investment trust determined without regard to the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Coordination with tax on undistributed income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A real estate investment trust shall be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution (other than in a redemption to which section 302(a) applies) which is treated as a dividend by such trust. The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent that the amount distributed during any calendar year by the trust <!-- PDFPage:1334 -->exceeds the required distribution for such calendar year (as determined under section 4981).</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amounts includible in gross income with respect to instruments to which section 1274 (relating to certain debt instruments issued for property) applies, exceed</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of money and the fair market value of other property received during the taxable year under such instruments; plus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any income on the disposition of a real estate asset if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there is a determination (as defined in section 860(e)) that such income is not eligible for nonrecognition under section 1031, and</p>

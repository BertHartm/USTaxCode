<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Designation of Place of Trial:</strong> The petitioner, at the time of filing the petition, shall file a designation of place of trial showing the place at which the petitioner would prefer the trial to be held. If the petitioner has not filed such designation, the Commissioner, at the time the answer is filed, shall file a designation showing the place of trial preferred by the Commissioner. The parties shall be notified of the place at which the trial will be held. For a list of places at which the Court has held trial sessions, see Appendix IV.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Form:</strong> Such designation shall be set forth on a paper separate from the petition or answer and shall consist of an original and two copies. See Form 4, Appendix I.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:30 --><p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Motion to Change Place of Trial:</strong> If a party desires a change in the designation of the place of trial, then such party shall file a motion to that effect, stating fully the reasons therefor. Such motions, made after the notice of the time of trial has been issued, ordinarily will be deemed dilatory and will be denied unless the ground therefor arose during that period or there was good reason for not making the motion sooner.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for collective bargaining agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any organization which is part of a plan maintained pursuant to an agreement between employee representatives and 1 or more employers if the Secretary finds that such agreement is a collective bargaining agreement and that such plan was the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee representatives and such employer or employers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nondiscrimination requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a plan meets the requirements of this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each class of benefits under the plan is provided under a classification of employees which is set forth in the plan and which is found by the Secretary not to be discriminatory in favor of employees who are highly compensated individuals, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) employees who are nonresident aliens and who receive no earned income (within the meaning of section 911(d)(2)) from the employer which constitutes income from sources within the United States (within the meaning of section 861(a)(3)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application of subsection where other nondiscrimination rules provided</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any benefit for which a provision of this chapter other than this subsection provides nondiscrimination rules, paragraph (1) shall not apply but the requirements of this subsection shall be met only if the nondiscrimination rules so provided are satisfied with respect to such benefit.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 414(s).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Compensation limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of this subsection unless under the plan the annual compensation of each employee taken into account for any year does not exceed $150,000. The Secretary shall adjust the $150,000 amount at the same time, and by the same amount, as any adjustment under section 401(a)(17)(B). This paragraph shall not apply in determining whether the requirements of section 79(d) are met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirement that organization notify Secretary that it is applying for tax-exempt status</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) unless it has given notice to the Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe, that it is applying for recognition of such status, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for any period before the giving of such notice, if such notice is given after the time prescribed by the Secretary by regulations for giving notice under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Treatment as expenses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A taxpayer may treat research or experimental expenditures which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable year in connection with his trade or business as expenses which are not chargeable to capital account. The expenditures so treated shall be allowed as a deduction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) When method may be adopted</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Without consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A taxpayer may, without the consent of the Secretary, adopt the method provided in this subsection for his first taxable year&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for which expenditures described in paragraph (1) are paid or incurred.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) With consent</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The method adopted under this subsection shall apply to all expenditures described in paragraph (1).

The election shall not apply to any expenditure paid or incurred during any taxable year before the taxable year for which the taxpayer makes the election.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, on the distribution of property by a corporation with respect to its stock, the earnings and profits of the corporation (to the extent thereof) shall be decreased by the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of money,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the principal amount of the obligations of such corporation (or, in the case of obligations having original issue discount, the aggregate issue price of such obligations), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the adjusted basis of the other property, so distributed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distributions of appreciated property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On the distribution by a corporation, with respect to its stock, of any property (other than an obligation of such corporation) the fair market value of which exceeds the adjusted basis thereof&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the earnings and profits of the corporation shall be increased by the amount of such excess, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subsection (a)(3) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; for &ldquo;adjusted basis&rdquo;.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subsection and subsection (a), the adjusted basis of any property is its adjusted basis as determined for purposes of computing earnings and profits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments for liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making the adjustments to the earnings and profits of a corporation under subsection (a) or (b), proper adjustment shall be made for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of any liability to which the property distributed is subject, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of any liability of the corporation assumed by a shareholder in connection with the distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certain distributions of stock and securities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The distribution to a distributee by or on behalf of a corporation of its stock or securities, of stock or securities in another corporation, or of property, in a distribution to which this title applies, shall not be considered a distribution of the earnings and profits of any corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if no gain to such distributee from the receipt of such stock or securities, or property, was recognized under this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the distribution was not subject to tax in the hands of such distributee by reason of section 305(a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prior distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a distribution of stock or securities, or property, to which section 115(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (or the corresponding provision of prior law) applied, the effect on earnings and profits of such distribution shall be determined under such section 115(h), or the corresponding provision of prior law, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Stock or securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;stock or securities&rdquo; includes rights to acquire stock or securities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect on earnings and profits of gain or loss and of receipt of tax-free distributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Effect on earnings and profits of gain or loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The gain or loss realized from the sale or other disposition (after February 28, 1913) of property by a corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the purpose of the computation of the earnings and profits of the corporation, shall (except as provided in subparagraph (B)) be determined by using as the adjusted basis the adjusted basis (under the law applicable to the year in which the sale or other disposition was made) for determining gain, except that no regard shall be had to the value of the property as of March 1, 1913; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for purposes of the computation of the earnings and profits of the corporation for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, shall be determined by using as the adjusted basis the adjusted basis (under the law applicable to the year in which the sale or other disposition was made) for determining gain.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Gain or loss so realized shall increase or decrease the earnings and profits to, but not be<!-- PDFPage:700 -->yond, the extent to which such a realized gain or loss was recognized in computing taxable income under the law applicable to the year in which such sale or disposition was made. Where, in determining the adjusted basis used in computing such realized gain or loss, the adjustment to the basis differs from the adjustment proper for the purpose of determining earnings and profits, then the latter adjustment shall be used in determining the increase or decrease above provided. For purposes of this subsection, a loss with respect to which a deduction is disallowed under section 1091 (relating to wash sales of stock or securities), or the corresponding provision of prior law, shall not be deemed to be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect on earnings and profits of receipt of tax-free distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where a corporation receives (after February 28, 1913) a distribution from a second corporation which (under the law applicable to the year in which the distribution was made) was not a taxable dividend to the shareholders of the second corporation, the amount of such distribution shall not increase the earnings and profits of the first corporation in the following cases:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no such increase shall be made in respect of the part of such distribution which (under such law) is directly applied in reduction of the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no such increase shall be made if (under such law) the distribution causes the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made to be allocated between such stock and the property received (or such basis would, but for section 307(b), be so allocated).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Earnings and profits&mdash;increase in value accrued before March 1, 1913</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If any increase or decrease in the earnings and profits for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, with respect to any matter would be different had the adjusted basis of the property involved been determined without regard to its March 1, 1913, value, then, except as provided in paragraph (2), an increase (properly reflecting such difference) shall be made in that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the application of subsection (f) to a sale or other disposition after February 28, 1913, results in a loss which is to be applied in decrease of earnings and profits for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, then, notwithstanding subsection (f) and in lieu of the rule provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of such loss so to be applied shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the adjusted basis of the property used in determining the loss exceeds the adjusted basis computed without regard to the value of the property on March 1, 1913, and if such amount so applied in reduction of the decrease exceeds such loss, the excess over such loss shall increase that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Allocation in certain corporate separations and reorganizations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Section 355</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a distribution or exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, proper allocation with respect to the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation and the controlled corporation (or corporations) shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Section 368(a)(1)(C) or (D)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a reorganization described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of section 368(a)(1), proper allocation with respect to the earnings and profits of the acquired corporation shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be made between the acquiring corporation and the acquired corporation (or any corporation which had control of the acquired corporation before the reorganization).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Distribution of proceeds of loan insured by the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a corporation distributes property with respect to its stock and if, at the time of distribution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is outstanding a loan to such corporation which was made, guaranteed, or insured by the United States (or by any agency or instrumentality thereof), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of such loan so outstanding exceeds the adjusted basis of the property constituting security for such loan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the earnings and profits of the corporation shall be increased by the amount of such excess, and (immediately after the distribution) shall be decreased by the amount of such excess. For purposes of paragraph (2), the adjusted basis of the property at the time of distribution shall be determined without regard to any adjustment under section 1016(a)(2) (relating to adjustment for depreciation, etc.). For purposes of this subsection, a commitment to make, guarantee, or insure a loan shall be treated as the making, guaranteeing, or insuring of a loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Earnings and profits of foreign investment companies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allocation within affiliated group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a sale or exchange of stock in a foreign investment company (as defined in section 1246(b)) by a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)), if such company is a member of an affiliated group, then the accumulated earnings and profits of all members of such affiliated group shall be allocated, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, in such manner as is proper to carry out the purposes of section 1246.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Affiliated group defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term &ldquo;affiliated group&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to such term by section 1504(a); except that (A) &ldquo;more than 50 percent&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;80 percent or more&rdquo;, and (B) all corporations shall be treated as includible corporations (without regard to the provisions of section 1504(b)).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:701 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Effect of depreciation on earnings and profits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of computing the earnings and profits of a corporation for any taxable year beginning after June 30, 1972, the allowance for depreciation (and amortization, if any) shall be deemed to be the amount which would be allowable for such year if the straight line method of depreciation had been used for each taxable year beginning after June 30, 1972.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If for any taxable year a method of depreciation was used by the taxpayer which the Secretary has determined results in a reasonable allowance under section 167(a) and which is the unit-of-production method or other method not expressed in a term of years, then the adjustment to earnings and profits for depreciation for such year shall be determined under the method so used (in lieu of the straight line method).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception for tangible property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in the case of tangible property to which section 168 applies, the adjustment to earnings and profits for depreciation for any taxable year shall be determined under the alternative depreciation system (within the meaning of section 168(g)(2)).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certain foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply in computing the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation for any taxable year for which less than 20 percent of the gross income from all sources of such corporation is derived from sources within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Basis adjustment not taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In computing the earnings and profits of a corporation for any taxable year, the allowance for depreciation (and amortization, if any) shall be computed without regard to any basis adjustment under section 50(c).</p>

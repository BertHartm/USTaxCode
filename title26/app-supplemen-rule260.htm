<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The petitioner's identification number (e.g., Social Security number or employer identification number) and current mailing address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A statement whether any dispute exists between the parties regarding either the fact or amount of interest payable in respect of the overpayment determined by the Court and, if such a dispute exists, clear and concise lettered statements of the facts regarding the dispute and the petitioner's position in respect of each disputed matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A copy of the Court's decision which determined the overpayment, together with a copy of any stipulation referred to therein and any computation filed pursuant to Rule 155 setting forth the amount and date of each payment made by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Response by Commissioner:</strong> Within 30 days after service of a motion filed pursuant to this Rule, the Commissioner shall file a written response. The response shall specifically admit or deny each allegation set forth in the petitioner's motion.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Disposition of Motion:</strong> A motion to enforce an overpayment determination filed pursuant to this Rule will ordinarily be disposed of without an evidentiary or other hearing unless it is clear from the motion and the Commissioner's written response that there is a bona fide factual dispute that cannot be resolved without an evidentiary hearing.</p>

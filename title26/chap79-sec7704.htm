<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Publicly traded partnership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;publicly traded partnership&rdquo; means any partnership if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) interests in such partnership are traded on an established securities market, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) interests in such partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception for partnerships with passive-type income</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall not apply to any publicly traded partnership for any taxable year if such partnership met the gross income requirements of paragraph (2) for such taxable year and each preceding taxable year beginning after December 31, 1987, during which the partnership (or any predecessor) was in existence. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a partnership shall not be treated as being in existence during any period before the 1st taxable year in which such partnership (or a predecessor) was a publicly traded partnership.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Gross income requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A partnership meets the gross income requirements of this paragraph for any taxable year if 90 percent or more of the gross income of such partnership for such taxable year consists of qualifying income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception not to apply to certain partnerships which could qualify as regulated investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to any partnership which would be described in section 851(a) if such partnership were a domestic corporation. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to any partnership a principal activity of which is the buying and selling of commodities (not described in section 1221(1)), or options, futures, or forwards with respect to commodities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) in the case of a partnership described in the second sentence of subsection (c)(3), income and gains from commodities (not described in section 1221(1)) or futures, for<!-- PDFPage:2901 -->wards, and options with respect to commodities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (E), the term &ldquo;mineral or natural resource&rdquo; means any product of a character with respect to which a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 611; except that such term shall not include any product described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 613(b)(7).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain interest not qualified</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest shall not be treated as qualifying income if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such interest is derived in the conduct of a financial or insurance business, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such interest would be excluded from the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo; under section 856(f).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Real property rent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;real property rent&rdquo; means amounts which would qualify as rent from real property under section 856(d) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such section were applied without regard to paragraph (2)(C) thereof (relating to independent contractor requirements), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a partner would not be considered as owned under section 318(a)(3)(A) by the partnership unless 5 percent or more (by value) of the interests in such partnership are owned, directly or indirectly, by or for such partner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certain income qualifying under regulated investment company or real estate trust provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualifying income&rdquo; also includes any income which would qualify under section 851(b)(2) or 856(c)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special rule for determining gross income from certain real property sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of the sale or other disposition of real property described in section 1221(1), gross income shall not be reduced by inventory costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Inadvertent terminations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a partnership fails to meet the gross income requirements of subsection (c)(2),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary determines that such failure was inadvertent,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) no later than a reasonable time after the discovery of such failure, steps are taken so that such partnership once more meets such gross income requirements, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such partnership agrees to make such adjustments (including adjustments with respect to the partners) or to pay such amounts as may be required by the Secretary with respect to such period,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then, notwithstanding such failure, such entity shall be treated as continuing to meet such gross income requirements for such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect of becoming corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As of the 1st day that a partnership is treated as a corporation under this section, for purposes of this title, such partnership shall be treated as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) transferring all of its assets (subject to its liabilities) to a newly formed corporation in exchange for the stock of the corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) distributing such stock to its partners in liquidation of their interests in the partnership.</p>

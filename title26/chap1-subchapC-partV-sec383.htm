<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Excess credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;excess credit&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

Such regulations shall provide that any such net capital loss used in a post-change year shall reduce the section 382 limitation which is applied to pre-change losses under section 382 for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Foreign tax credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation, the amount of any excess foreign taxes under section 904(c) for any taxable year before the 1st post-change taxable year shall be limited under regulations which shall be consistent with purposes of this section and section 382.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If contributions are paid by an employer to or under a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or if compensation is paid or accrued on account of any employee under a plan deferring the receipt of such compensation, such contributions or compensation shall not be deductible under this chapter; but, if they would otherwise be deductible, they shall be deductible under this section, subject, however, to the following limitations as to the amounts deductible in any year:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pension trusts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the taxable year when paid, if the contributions are paid into a pension trust, and if such taxable year ends within or with a taxable year of the trust for which the trust is exempt under section 501(a), in an amount determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412(a) for plan years ending within or with such taxable year (or for any prior plan year), if such amount is greater than the amount determined under clause (ii) or (iii) (whichever is applicable with respect to the plan),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount necessary to provide with respect to all of the employees under the trust the remaining unfunded cost of their past and current service credits distributed as a level amount, or a level percentage of compensation, over the remaining future service of each such employee, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, but if such remaining unfunded cost with respect to any 3 individuals is more than 50 percent of such remaining unfunded cost, the amount of such unfunded cost attributable to such individuals shall be distributed over a period of at least 5 taxable years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an amount equal to the normal cost of the plan, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, plus, if past service or other supplementary pension or annuity credits are provided by the plan, an amount necessary to amortize the unfunded costs attributable to such credits in equal annual payments (until fully amortized) over 10 years, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In determining the amount deductible in such year under the foregoing limitations the funding method and the actuarial assumptions used shall be those used for such year under section 412, and the maximum amount deductible for such year shall be an amount equal to the full funding limitation for such year determined under section 412.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule in case of certain amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan which the Secretary of Labor finds to be collectively bargained which makes an election under this subparagraph (in such manner and at such time as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary), if the full funding limitation determined under section 412(c)(7) for such year is zero, if as a result of any plan amendment applying to such plan year, the amount determined under section 412(c)(7)(B) exceeds the amount determined under section 412(c)(7)(A), and if the funding method and the actuarial assumptions used are those used for such year under section 412, the maximum amount deductible in such year under the limitations of this paragraph shall be an amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the full funding limitation for such year determined by applying section 412(c)(7) but increasing the amount referred to in subparagraph (A) thereof by the decrease in the present value of all unamortized liabilities resulting from such amendment, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the normal cost under the plan reduced by the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments over 10 years (until fully amortized) the decrease described in clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In the case of any election under this subparagraph, the amount deductible under the limitations of this paragraph with respect to any of the plan years following the plan year for which such election was made shall be determined as provided under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain collectively-bargained plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan which the Secretary of Labor finds to be collectively bargained, established or maintained by an employer doing business in not less than 40 States and engaged in the trade or business of furnishing or selling services described in section 168(i)(10)(C), with respect to which the rates have been established or approved by a State or political subdivision thereof, by any agency or instrumentality of the United States, or by a public service or public utility commission or other similar body of any State or political subdivision thereof, and in the case of any employer which is a member of a controlled group with such employer, subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substitut<!-- PDFPage:845 -->ing for the words &ldquo;plan amendment&rdquo; the words &ldquo;plan amendment or increase in benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act&rdquo;. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; has the meaning provided by section 1563(a), determined without regard to section 1563(a)(4) and (e)(3)(C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rule in case of certain plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) which has more than 100 participants for the plan year, except as provided in regulations, the maximum amount deductible under the limitations of this paragraph shall not be less than the unfunded current liability determined under section 412(<em>l</em>). For purposes of determining whether a plan has more than 100 participants, all defined benefit plans maintained by the same employer (or any member of such employer's controlled group (within the meaning of section 412(<em>l</em>)(8)(c))) shall be treated as 1 plan, but only employees of such member or employer shall be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Carryover</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid in a taxable year in excess of the amount deductible in such year under the foregoing limitations shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time to the extent of the difference between the amount paid and deductible in each such succeeding year and the maximum amount deductible for such year under the foregoing limitations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Employees&rsquo; annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the taxable year when paid, in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (1), if the contributions are paid toward the purchase of retirement annuities, or retirement annuities and medical benefits as described in section 401(h), and such purchase is part of a plan which meets the requirements of section 401(a)(3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17),<sup><a href="#404_1_target" name="404_1">1</a></sup> (19), (20), (22), (26), (27), and (31) and, if applicable, the requirements of section 401(a)(10) and of section 401(d), and if refunds of premiums, if any, are applied within the current taxable year or next succeeding taxable year toward the purchase of such retirement annuities, or such retirement annuities and medical benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Stock bonus and profit-sharing trusts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limits on deductible contributions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the taxable year when paid, if the contributions are paid into a stock bonus or profit-sharing trust, and if such taxable year ends within or with a taxable year of the trust with respect to which the trust is exempt under section 501(a), in an amount not in excess of the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 15 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under the stock bonus or profit-sharing plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the amount such employer is required to contribute to such trust under section 401(k)(11) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Carryover of excess contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any amount paid into the trust in any taxable year in excess of the limitation of clause (i) (or the corresponding provision of prior law) shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this clause in any 1 such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under clause (i) shall not exceed the amount described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i), whichever is greater, with respect to such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Certain retirement plans excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;stock bonus or profit-sharing trust&rdquo; shall not include any trust designed to provide benefits upon retirement and covering a period of years, if under the plan the amounts to be contributed by the employer can be determined actuarially as provided in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) 2 or more trusts treated as 1 trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the contributions are made to 2 or more stock bonus or profit-sharing trusts, such trusts shall be considered a single trust for purposes of applying the limitations in this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Pre-87 limitation carryforwards</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The limitation of clause (i) for any taxable year shall be increased by the unused pre-87 limitation carryforwards (but not to an amount in excess of 25 percent of the compensation described in clause (i)).</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Unused pre-87 limitation carryforwards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">For purposes of subclause (I), the term &ldquo;unused pre-87 limitation carryforwards&rdquo; means the amount by which the limitation of the first sentence of this subparagraph (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986) for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, exceeded the amount paid to the trust for such taxable year (to the extent such excess was not taken into account in prior taxable years).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Profit-sharing plan of affiliated group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a profit-sharing plan, or a stock bonus plan in which contributions are determined with reference to profits, of a group of corporations which is an affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504, if any member of such affiliated group is prevented from making a contribution which it would otherwise have made under the plan, by reason of having no current or accumulated earnings or profits or because such earnings or profits are less than the contributions which it would otherwise have made, then so much of the contribution <!-- PDFPage:846 -->which such member was so prevented from making may be made, for the benefit of the employees of such member, by the other members of the group, to the extent of current or accumulated earnings or profits, except that such contribution by each such other member shall be limited, where the group does not file a consolidated return, to that proportion of its total current and accumulated earnings or profits remaining after adjustment for its contribution deductible without regard to this subparagraph which the total prevented contribution bears to the total current and accumulated earnings or profits of all the members of the group remaining after adjustment for all contributions deductible without regard to this subparagraph. Contributions made under the preceding sentence shall be deductible under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by the employer making such contribution, and, for the purpose of determining amounts which may be carried forward and deducted under the second sentence of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in succeeding taxable years, shall be deemed to have been made by the employer on behalf of whose employees such contributions were made. The term &ldquo;compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to all employees&rdquo; shall include any amount with respect to which an election under section 415(c)(3)(C) is in effect, but only to the extent that any contribution with respect to such amount is nonforfeitable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Trusts created or organized outside the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing trust would qualify for exemption under section 501(a) except for the fact that it is a trust created or organized outside the United States, contributions to such a trust by an employer which is a resident, or corporation, or other entity of the United States, shall be deductible under the preceding paragraphs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Other plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the plan is not one included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3), in the taxable year in which an amount attributable to the contribution is includible in the gross income of employees participating in the plan, but, in the case of a plan in which more than one employee participates only if separate accounts are maintained for each employee. For purposes of this section, any vacation pay which is treated as deferred compensation shall be deductible for the taxable year of the employer in which paid to the employee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Time when contributions deemed made</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), a taxpayer shall be deemed to have made a payment on the last day of the preceding taxable year if the payment is on account of such taxable year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (including extensions thereof).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Limitation on deductions where combination of defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If amounts are deductible under the foregoing paragraphs of this subsection (other than paragraph (5)) in connection with 1 or more defined contribution plans and 1 or more defined benefit plans or in connection with trusts or plans described in 2 or more of such paragraphs, the total amount deductible in a taxable year under such plans shall not exceed the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under such plans, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of contributions made to or under the defined benefit plans to the extent such contributions do not exceed the amount of employer contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412 with respect to any such defined benefit plans for the plan year which ends with or within such taxable year (or for any prior plan year).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">A defined contribution plan which is a pension plan shall not be treated as failing to provide definitely determinable benefits merely by limiting employer contributions to amounts deductible under this section. For purposes of clause (ii), if paragraph (1)(D) applies to a defined benefit plan for any plan year, the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412 with respect to such plan for such plan year shall not be less than the unfunded current liability of such plan under section 412(<em>l</em>).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Carryover of contributions in excess of the deductible limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid under the plans in any taxable year in excess of the limitation of subparagraph (A) shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this subparagraph in any 1 such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under subparagraph (A) shall not exceed 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during such taxable year to the beneficiaries under the plans.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Paragraph not to apply in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not have the effect of reducing the amount otherwise deductible under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), if no employee is a beneficiary under more than 1 trust or under a trust and an annuity plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Section 412(i) plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, any plan described in section 412(i) shall be treated as a defined benefit plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Self-employed individuals</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; includes an individual who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), and the employer of such individual is the person treated as his employer under section 401(c)(4);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the term &ldquo;earned income&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 401(c)(2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the contributions to such plan on behalf of an individual who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) shall be considered to satisfy the conditions of section 162 or 212 to the extent that such contributions do not exceed the earned income of such individual (determined without regard to the deductions allowed by this section) derived from the trade or business with respect to which such plan is established, and to the extent that such contributions are not allocable (determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the purchase of life, accident, health, or other insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any reference to compensation shall, in the case of an individual who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), be considered to be a reference to the earned income of such individual derived from the trade or business with respect to which the plan is established.</p>

The amount deductible under this paragraph shall not, however, exceed 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the employees under such employee stock ownership plan.

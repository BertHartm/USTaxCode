<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General:</strong> Any case not requiring a trial for the submission of evidence (as, for example, where sufficient facts have been admitted, stipulated, established by deposition, or included in the record in some other way) may be submitted at any time by motion of the parties filed with the Court. The parties need not wait for the case to be calendared for trial and need not appear in Court. The Chief Judge will assign such a case to a Judge or Special Trial Judge, who will fix a time for filing briefs or for oral argument.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Burden of Proof:</strong> The fact of submission of a case, under paragraph (a) of this Rule, does not alter the burden of proof, or the requirements otherwise applicable with respect to adducing proof, or the effect of failure of proof.</p>

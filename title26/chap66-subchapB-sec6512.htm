<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) As to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the making of levy or beginning a proceeding in court for collection has expired; but in any such claim for credit or refund or in any such suit for refund the decision of the Tax Court which has become final, as to whether such period has expired before the notice of deficiency was mailed, shall be conclusive,<sup><a href="#6512_1_target" name="6512_1">1</a></sup> and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) As to overpayments attributable to partnership items, in accordance with subchapter C of chapter 63.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdiction to enforce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after 120 days after a decision of the Tax Court has become final, the Secretary has failed to refund the overpayment determined by the Tax Court, together with the interest thereon as provided in subchapter B of chapter 67, then the Tax Court, upon motion by the taxpayer, shall have jurisdiction to order the refund of such overpayment and interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limit on amount of credit or refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No such credit or refund shall be allowed or made of any portion of the tax unless the Tax Court determines as part of its decision that such portion was paid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) after the mailing of the notice of deficiency,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) within the period which would be applicable under section 6511(b)(2), (c), or (d), if on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim had been filed (whether or not filed) stating the grounds upon which the Tax Court finds that there is an overpayment, or</p>

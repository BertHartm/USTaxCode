<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exchanges of stock or securities only</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain or loss shall be recognized to the transferor if stock or securities in a corporation which is a registered holding company or a majority-owned subsidiary company are transferred to such corporation or to an associate company thereof which is a registered holding company or a majority-owned subsidiary company solely in exchange for stock or securities (other than stock or securities which are nonexempt property), and the exchange is made by the transferee corporation in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exchanges and sales of property by corporations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No gain shall be recognized to a transferor corporation which is a registered holding company or an associate company of a registered holding company, if such corporation, in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission, transfers property in ex<!-- PDFPage:1519 -->change for property, and such order recites that such exchange by the transferor corporation is necessary or appropriate to the integration or simplification of the holding company system of which the transferor corporation is a member. Any gain, to the extent that it cannot be applied in reduction of basis under section 1082(a)(2), shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nonexempt property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any such property so received is nonexempt property, gain shall be recognized unless such nonexempt property or an amount equal to the fair market value of such property at the time of the transfer is, within 24 months of the transfer, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, and in accordance with an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission, expended for property other than nonexempt property or is invested as a contribution to the capital, or as paid-in surplus, of another corporation, and such order recites that such expenditure or investment by the transferor corporation is necessary or appropriate to the integration or simplification of the holding company system of which the transferor corporation is a member. If the fair market value of such nonexempt property at the time of the transfer exceeds the amount expended and the amount invested, as required in the preceding sentence, the gain, if any, to the extent of such excess, shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Cancellation or redemption of stock or securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a distribution in cancellation or redemption (except a distribution having the effect of a dividend) of the whole or a part of the transferor's own stock (not acquired on the transfer) and a payment in complete or partial retirement or cancellation of securities representing indebtedness of the transferor or a complete or partial retirement or cancellation of such securities which is a part of the consideration for the transfer shall be considered an expenditure for property other than nonexempt property, and if, on the transfer, a liability of the transferor is assumed, or property of the transferor is transferred subject to a liability, the amount of such liability shall be considered to be an expenditure by the transferor for property other than nonexempt property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Consents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply unless the transferor corporation consents, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe to the regulations prescribed under section 1082(a)(2) in effect at the time of filing its return for the taxable year in which the transfer occurs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Distribution of stock or securities only</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If there is distributed, in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to a shareholder in a corporation which is a registered holding company or a majority-owned subsidiary company, stock or securities (other than stock or securities which are nonexempt property), without the surrender by such shareholder of stock or securities in such corporation, no gain to the distributee from the receipt of the stock or securities so distributed shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfers within system group</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation which is a member of a system group&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if such corporation transfers property to another corporation which is a member of the same system group in exchange for other property, and the exchange by each corporation is made in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if there is distributed to such corporation as a shareholder in a corporation which is a member of the same system group, property, without the surrender by such shareholder of stock or securities in the corporation making the distribution, and the distribution is made and received in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If an exchange by or a distribution to a corporation with respect to which no gain or loss is recognized under any of the provisions of this paragraph may also be considered to be within the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c), then the provisions of this paragraph only shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sales of stock or securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the property received on an exchange which is within any of the provisions of paragraph (1) consists in whole or in part of stock or securities issued by the corporation from which such property was received, and if in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission such stock or securities (other than stock which is not preferred as to both dividends and assets) are sold and the proceeds derived therefrom are applied in whole or in part in the retirement or cancellation of stock or of securities of the recipient corporation outstanding at the time of such exchange, no gain or loss shall be recognized to the recipient corporation on the sale of the stock or securities with respect to which such order was made; except that if any part of the proceeds derived from the sale of such stock or securities is not so applied, or if the amount of such proceeds is in excess of the fair market value of such stock or securities at the time of such exchange, the gain, if any, shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the proceeds which are not so applied, or in an amount not more than the amount by which the proceeds derived from such sale exceed such fair market value, whichever is the greater.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exchanges not solely in kind</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an exchange (not within any of the provisions of subsection (d)) would be within the provisions of subsection (a) if it were not for the fact that property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by such subsection to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other <!-- PDFPage:1520 -->property or money, then the gain, if any, to the recipient shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property, and the loss, if any, to the recipient shall not be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distribution treated as dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an exchange is within the provisions of paragraph (1) and if it includes a distribution which has the effect of the distribution of a taxable dividend, then there shall be taxed as a dividend to each distributee such an amount of the gain recognized under such paragraph as is not in excess of his ratable share of the undistributed earnings and profits of the corporation accumulated after February 28, 1913. The remainder, if any, of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) shall be taxed as a gain from the exchange of property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Conditions for application of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply to an exchange, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the order of the Securities and Exchange Commission in obedience to which such exchange, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale was made recites that such exchange, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale is necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of section 11(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79k(b)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such order specifies and itemizes the stock and securities and other property which are ordered to be acquired, transferred, received, or sold on such exchange, acquisition, expenditure, distribution, or sale, and, in the case of an investment, the investment to be made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such exchange, acquisition, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale was made in obedience to such order, and was completed within the time prescribed therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Nonapplication of other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an exchange or distribution made in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission is within any of the provisions of this part and may also be considered to be within any of the other provisions of this subchapter or subchapter C (sec. 301 and following, relating to corporate distributions and adjustments), then the provisions of this part only shall apply.</p>

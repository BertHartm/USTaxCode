<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an employer who makes a contribution to the medical savings account of any employee with respect to coverage under a high deductible health plan of the employer during a calendar year, there is hereby imposed a tax on the failure of such employer to meet the requirements of subsection (d) for such calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of the tax imposed by subsection (a) on any failure for any calendar year is the amount equal to 35 percent of the aggregate amount contributed by the employer to medical savings accounts of employees for taxable years of such employees ending with or within such calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a failure which is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the Secretary may waive part or all of the tax imposed by subsection (a) to the extent that the payment of such tax would be excessive relative to the failure involved.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Part-year employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an employee who is employed by the employer for only a portion of the calendar year, a contribution to the medical savings account of such employee shall be treated as comparable if it is an amount which bears the same ratio to the comparable amount (determined without regard to this subparagraph) as such portion bears to the entire calendar year.</p>

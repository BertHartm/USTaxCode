<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deemed distributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Distributions in qualified years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A shareholder of a DISC shall be treated as having received a distribution taxable as a dividend with respect to his stock in an amount which is equal to his pro rata share of the sum (or, if smaller, the earnings and profits for the taxable year) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the gross interest derived during the taxable year from producer's loans,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the gain recognized by the DISC during the taxable year on the sale or exchange of property, other than property which in the hands of the DISC is a qualified export asset, previously transferred to it in a transaction in which gain was not recognized in whole or in part, but only to the extent that the transferor's gain on the previous transfer was not recognized,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the gain (other than the gain described in subparagraph (B)) recognized by the DISC during the taxable year on the sale or exchange of property (other than property which in the hands of the DISC is stock in trade or other property described in section 1221(1)) previously transferred to it in a transaction in which gain was not recognized in whole or in part, but only to the extent that the transferor's gain on the previous transfer was not recognized and would have been treated as ordinary income if the property has been sold or exchanged rather than transferred to the DISC,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) 50 percent of the taxable income of the DISC for the taxable year attributable to military property,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the taxable income of the DISC attributable to qualified export receipts of the DISC for the taxable year which exceed $10,000,000,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an amount equal to 16/17 of the excess referred to in clause (i), multiplied by the international boycott factor determined under section 999, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any illegal bribe, kickback, or other payment (within the meaning of section 162(c)) paid by or on behalf of the DISC directly or indirectly to an official, employee, or agent in fact of a government, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />

In the case of a distribution described in subparagraph (G), earnings and profits for the taxable year shall include accumulated earnings and profits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distributions upon disqualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A shareholder of a corporation which revoked its election to be treated as a DISC or failed to satisfy the conditions of section 992(a)(1) for a taxable year shall be deemed to have received (at the time specified in subparagraph (B)) a distribution taxable as a dividend equal to his pro rata share of the DISC income of such corporation accumulated during the immediately preceding consecutive taxable years for which the corporation was a DISC.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Distributions described in subparagraph (A) shall be deemed to be received in equal installments on the last day of each of the 10 taxable years of the corporation following the year of the termination or disqualification described in subparagraph (A) (but in no case over more than twice the number immediately preceding consecutive taxable years during which the corporation was a DISC).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Taxable income attributable to military property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(D), taxable income of a DISC for the taxable year attributable to military property shall be determined by only taking into account&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the deductions which are properly apportioned or allocated to such income.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Gain on disposition of stock in a DISC</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) stock of a DISC or former DISC is disposed of in a transaction in which the separate corporate existence of the DISC or former DISC is terminated other than by a mere change in place of organization, however effected, any gain realized on the disposition of such stock in the transaction shall be recognized notwithstanding any other provision of this title to the extent provided in paragraph (2) and to the extent so recognized shall be included in gross income as a dividend.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount included</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amounts described in paragraph (1) shall be included in gross income as a dividend to the extent of the accumulated DISC income of the DISC or former DISC which is attributable to the stock disposed of and which was accumulated in taxable years of such corporation during the period or periods the stock disposed of was held by the shareholder which disposed of such stock.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, assets which are qualified export assets of a DISC (or would be qualified export assets if owned by a DISC) shall not be taken into account. Amounts described in this paragraph (other than in subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (v)) shall be taken into account only to the extent they are attributable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;domestic member&rdquo; means a domestic corporation which is a member of a controlled group (as defined in section 993(a)(3)), and the term &ldquo;foreign member&rdquo; means a foreign corporation which is a member of such a controlled group.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary by regulations shall prescribe, transfers of assets, stock, or both, will be deemed to be a reorganization within the meaning of section 368, a transaction to which section 355 applies, an exchange of stock to which section 351 applies, or a combination thereof. The preceding sentence shall apply only to the extent that the transfer or transfers involved are for the purpose of preventing the separation of the ownership of the stock in the DISC from the ownership of the trade or business which (during the base period) produced the export gross receipts of the DISC.</p>

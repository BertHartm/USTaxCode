<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unrecovered losses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the amount of any unrecovered loss sustained as a result of any compensable injury is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of the amount of the net operating losses (as determined under section 172) for each taxable year in whole or in part within the injury period, to the extent that such net operating losses are attributable to such compensable injury, reduced by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a net operating loss for any taxable year shall be treated as attributable to a compensable injury to the extent of the compensable injury sustained during such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if only a portion of a net operating loss for any taxable year is attributable to a compensable injury, such portion shall (in applying section 172 for purposes of this section) be considered to be a separate net operating loss for such year to be applied after the other portion of such net operating loss.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect on net operating loss carryovers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If for the taxable year in which a compensatory amount is received or accrued any portion of a net operating loss carryover to such year is attributable to the compensable injury for which such amount is received or accrued, such portion of such net operating loss carryover shall be reduced by an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deduction allowed under subsection (a) with respect to such compensatory amount, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any portion of the unrecovered losses sustained as a result of the compensable injury with respect to which the period for carryover under section 172 has expired.</p>

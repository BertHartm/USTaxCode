Such extension may exceed 6 months in the case of a taxpayer who is abroad.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Estate tax</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Extensions of time for payment of any portion of a claim for tax under chapter 1 or chapter 12, allowed in cases under title 11 of the United States Code or in receivership proceedings, which is unpaid, may be had in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as provided in subsection (b) in respect of a deficiency in such tax.</p>

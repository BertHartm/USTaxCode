<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Regular interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;regular interest&rdquo; means any interest in a REMIC which is issued on the startup day with fixed terms and which is designated as a regular interest if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such interest unconditionally entitles the holder to receive a specified principal amount (or other similar amount), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) interest payments (or other similar amount), if any, with respect to such interest at or before maturity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are payable based on a fixed rate (or to the extent provided in regulations, at a variable rate), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consist of a specified portion of the interest payments on qualified mortgages and such portion does not vary during the period such interest is outstanding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The interest shall not fail to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) merely because the timing (but not the amount) of the principal payments (or other similar amounts) may be contingent on the extent of prepayments on qualified mortgages and the amount of income from permitted investments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Residual interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;residual interest&rdquo; means an interest in a REMIC which is issued on the startup day, which is not a regular interest, and which is designated as a residual interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualified mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualified mortgage&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any obligation (including any participation or certificate of beneficial ownership therein) which is principally secured by an interest in real property and which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is transferred to the REMIC on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is purchased by the REMIC within the 3-month period beginning on the startup day if, except as provided in regulations, such purchase is pursuant to a fixed-price contract in effect on the startup day,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any qualified replacement mortgage, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any regular interest in another REMIC transferred to the REMIC on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), any obligation secured by stock held by a person as a tenant-stockholder (as defined in section 216) in a cooperative housing corporation (as so defined) shall be treated as secured by an interest in real property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Qualified replacement mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualified replacement mortgage&rdquo; means any obligation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which would be a qualified mortgage if transferred on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is received for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) another obligation within the 3-month period beginning on the startup day, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a defective obligation within the 2-year period beginning on the startup day.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Permitted investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;permitted investments&rdquo; means any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) cash flow investment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) qualified reserve asset, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) foreclosure property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Cash flow investment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;cash flow investment&rdquo; means any investment of amounts received under qualified mortgages for a temporary period before distribution to holders of interests in the REMIC.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Qualified reserve asset</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;qualified reserve asset&rdquo; means any intangible property which is held for investment and as part of a qualified reserve fund.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1286 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified reserve fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;qualified reserve fund&rdquo; means any reasonably required reserve to provide for full payment of expenses of the REMIC or amounts due on regular interests in the event of defaults on qualified mortgages or lower than expected returns on cash flow investments. The amount of any such reserve shall be promptly and appropriately reduced as payments of qualified mortgages are received.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A reserve shall not be treated as a qualified reserve for any taxable year (and all subsequent taxable years) if more than 30 percent of the gross income from the assets in such fund for the taxable year is derived from the sale or other disposition of property held for less than 3 months. For purposes of the preceding sentence, gain on the disposition of a qualified reserve asset shall not be taken into account if the disposition giving rise to such gain is required to prevent default on a regular interest where the threatened default resulted from a default on 1 or more qualified mortgages.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Foreclosure property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;foreclosure property&rdquo; means property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which would be foreclosure property under section 856(e) (without regard to paragraph (5) thereof) if acquired by a real estate investment trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is acquired in connection with the default or imminent default of a qualified mortgage held by the REMIC.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Solely for purposes of section 860D(a), the determination of whether any property is foreclosure property shall be made without regard to section 856(e)(4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Startup day</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;startup day&rdquo; means the day on which the REMIC issues all of its regular and residual interests. To the extent provided in regulations, all interests issued (and all transfers to the REMIC) during any period (not exceeding 10 days) permitted in such regulations shall be treated as occurring on the day during such period selected by the REMIC for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Issue price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The issue price of any regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be determined under section 1273(b) in the same manner as if such interest were a debt instrument; except that if the interest is issued for property, paragraph (3) of section 1273(b) shall apply whether or not the requirements of such paragraph are met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Treatment of nonresident aliens and foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the holder of a residual interest in a REMIC is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, and 1442&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amounts includible in the gross income of such holder under this part shall be taken into account when paid or distributed (or when the interest is disposed of), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no exemption from the taxes imposed by such sections (and no reduction in the rates of such taxes) shall apply to any excess inclusion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may by regulations provide that such amounts shall be taken into account earlier than as provided in paragraph (1) where necessary or appropriate to prevent the avoidance of tax imposed by this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tax on income from foreclosure property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the net income from foreclosure property of each REMIC. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying the net income from foreclosure property by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Net income from foreclosure property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;net income from foreclosure property&rdquo; means the amount which would be the REMIC's net income from foreclosure property under section 857(b)(4)(B) if the REMIC were a real estate investment trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tax on contributions after startup date</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), if any amount is contributed to a REMIC after the startup day, there is hereby imposed a tax for the taxable year of the REMIC in which the contribution is received equal to 100 percent of the amount of such contribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any contribution which is made in cash and is described in any of the following subparagraphs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Any contribution to facilitate a clean-up call (as defined in regulations) or a qualified liquidation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Any payment in the nature of a guarantee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Any contribution during the 3-month period beginning on the startup day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Any contribution to a qualified reserve fund by any holder of a residual interest in the REMIC.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Any other contribution permitted in regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this part, including regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to prevent unreasonable accumulations of assets in a REMIC,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) permitting determinations of the fair market value of property transferred to a REMIC and issue price of interests in a REMIC to be made earlier than otherwise provided,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requiring reporting to holders of residual interests of such information as frequently as is necessary or appropriate to permit such holders to compute their taxable income accurately,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) providing appropriate rules for treatment of transfers of qualified replacement mortgages to the REMIC where the transferor holds any interest in the REMIC, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1287 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) providing that a mortgage will be treated as a qualified replacement mortgage only if it is part of a bona fide replacement (and not part of a swap of mortgages).</p>

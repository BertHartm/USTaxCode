<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule for application of certain losses against income of insurance companies taxed under section 801</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an election under section 1504(c)(2) is in effect for the taxable year and the consolidated taxable income of the members of the group not taxed under section 801 results in a consolidated net operating loss for such taxable <!-- PDFPage:1867 -->year, then under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the amount of such loss which cannot be absorbed in the applicable carry-back periods against the taxable income of such members not taxed under section 801 shall be taken into account in determining the consolidated taxable income of the affiliated group for such taxable year to the extent of 35 percent of such loss or 35 percent of the taxable income of the members taxed under section 801, whichever is less. The unused portion of such loss shall be available as a carryover, subject to the same limitations (applicable to the sum of the loss for the carryover year and the loss (or losses) carried over to such year), in applicable carryover years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Losses of recent nonlife affiliates</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Dual consolidated loss</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of losses of separate business units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent provided in regulations, any loss of a separate unit of a domestic corporation shall be subject to the limitations of this subsection in the same manner as if such unit were a wholly owned subsidiary of such corporation.</p>

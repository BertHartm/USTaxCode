<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) accumulated earnings and profits at the close of such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) gross receipts more than 25 percent of which are passive investment income,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">then there is hereby imposed a tax on the income of such corporation for such taxable year. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying the excess net passive income by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1731 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term &ldquo;excess net passive income&rdquo; means an amount which bears the same ratio to the net passive income for the taxable year as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount by which the passive investment income for the taxable year exceeds 25 percent of the gross receipts for the taxable year, bears to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the passive investment income for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of the excess net passive income for any taxable year shall not exceed the amount of the corporation's taxable income for such taxable year as determined under section 63(a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) without regard to the deductions allowed by part VIII of subchapter B (other than the deduction allowed by section 248, relating to organization expenditures), and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Coordination with section 1374</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If the S corporation establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it determined in good faith that it had no subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of a taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) during a reasonable period of time after it was determined that it did have subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of such taxable year such earnings and profits were distributed,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receipt of certification from the Commission under subsection (g), the Secretary shall make payments from the appropriate account maintained under subsection (a) to the national committee of a major party or minor party which elects to receive its entitlement under this subsection.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The entitlements established by this subsection shall be adjusted in the same manner as expenditure limitations established by section 315(b) and section 315(d) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 are adjusted pursuant to the provisions of section 315(c) of such Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of funds</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minor parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided by paragraph (3), the national committee of a minor party may not make expenditures with respect to a presidential nominating convention which, in the aggregate, exceed the amount of the entitlement of the national committee of a major party under subsection (b)(1).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Provision of legal or accounting services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the payment, by any person other than the national committee of a political party (unless the person paying for such services is a person other than the regular employer of the individual rendering such services) of compensation to any individual for legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of the national committee of a political party shall not be treated as an expenditure made by or on behalf of such committee with respect to its limitations on presidential nominating convention expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The national committee of a major party or minor party may receive payments under subsection (b)(3) beginning on July 1 of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which a presidential nominating convention of the political party involved is held.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer to the fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, after the close of a presidential nominating convention and after the national committee of the political party involved has been paid the amount which it is entitled to receive under this section, there are moneys remaining in the account of such national committee, the Secretary shall transfer the moneys so remaining to the fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A tax computed in accordance with the table contained in section 2001 is hereby imposed on the transfer of the taxable estate, determined as provided in section 2106, of every decedent nonresident not a citizen of the United States if, within the 10-year period ending with the date of death, such decedent lost United States citizenship, unless such loss did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes under this subtitle or subtitle A.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain individuals treated as having tax avoidance purpose</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), an individual shall be treated as having a principal purpose to avoid such taxes if such individual is so treated under section 877(a)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the total value of the stock of such corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then that proportion of the fair market value of the stock of such foreign corporation owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by such decedent at the time of his death, which the fair market value of any assets owned by such foreign corporation and situated in the United States, at the time of his death, bears to the total fair market value of all assets owned by such foreign corporation at the time of his death, shall be included in the gross estate of such decedent. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a decedent shall be treated as owning stock of a foreign corporation at the time of his death if, at the time of a transfer, by trust or otherwise, within the meaning of sections 2035 to 2038, inclusive, he owned such stock.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit for foreign death taxes</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be credited with the amount of any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any foreign country in respect of any property which is included in the gross estate solely by reason of subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation on credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The credit allowed by subparagraph (A) for such taxes paid to a foreign country shall not exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of such taxes actually paid to such foreign country in respect of property included in the gross estate as the value of the property included in the gross estate solely by reason of subsection (b) bears to the value of all property subjected to such taxes by such foreign country, or</p>

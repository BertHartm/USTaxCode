<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rate of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A tax computed in accordance with the table contained in section 2001 is hereby imposed on the transfer of the taxable estate, determined as provided in section 2106, of every decedent nonresident not a citizen of the United States dying after November 13, 1966, if after March 8, 1965, and within the 10-year period ending with the date of death such decedent lost United States citizenship, unless such loss did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes under this subtitle or subtitle A.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Gross estate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of the tax imposed by subsection (a), the value of the gross estate of every decedent to whom subsection (a) applies shall be determined as provided in section 2103, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if such decedent owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) at the time of his death 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of a foreign corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such decedent owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)), or is considered to have owned (by applying the ownership rules of section 958(b)), at the time of his death, more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such foreign corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then that proportion of the fair market value of the stock of such foreign corporation owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by such decedent at the time of his death, which the fair market value of any assets owned by such foreign corporation and situated in the United States, at the time of his death, bears to the total fair market value of all assets owned by such foreign corporation at the time of his death, shall be included in the gross estate of such decedent. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a decedent shall be treated as owning stock of a foreign corporation at the time of his death if, at the time of a transfer, by trust or otherwise, within the meaning of sections 2035 to 2038, inclusive, he owned such stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Credits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Unified credit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A credit of $13,000 shall be allowed against the tax imposed by subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation based on amount of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The credit allowed under this paragraph shall not exceed the amount of the tax imposed by subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be credited with the amounts determined in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of section 2102. For purposes of subsection (a) of section 2102, sections 2011 to 2013, inclusive, shall be applied as if the credit allowed under paragraph (1) were allowed under section 2010.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for loss of citizenship for certain causes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to the transfer of the estate of a decedent whose loss of United States citizenship resulted from the application of section 301(b), 350, or 355&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2107_1_target" name="2107_1">1</a></sup> of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1401(b), 1482, or 1487).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary establishes that it is reasonable to believe that an individual's loss of United States citizenship would, but for this section, result in a substantial reduction in the estate, inheritance, legacy, and succession taxes in respect of the transfer of his estate, the burden of proving that such loss of citizenship did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes under this subtitle or subtitle A shall be on the executor of such individual's estate.</p>

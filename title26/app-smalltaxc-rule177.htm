If the petitioner has not filed such a designation, then the Commissioner shall, within 30 days after the date of service of the petition, file a designation showing the place of trial preferred by the Commissioner. The Court will make every effort to conduct the trial at the location most convenient to that designated where suitable facilities are available.</p>

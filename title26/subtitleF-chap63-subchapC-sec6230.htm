<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Coordination with deficiency proceedings</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), subchapter B of this chapter shall not apply to the assessment or collection of any computational adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deficiency proceedings to apply in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Subchapter B shall apply to any deficiency attributable to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) affected items which require partner level determinations (other than penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts that relate to adjustments to partnership items), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) items which have become nonpartnership items (other than by reason of sec<!-- PDFPage:2673 -->tion 6231(b)(1)(C)) and are described in section 6231(e)(1)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Subchapter B shall be applied separately with respect to each deficiency described in subparagraph (A) attributable to each partnership.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, any notice or proceeding under subchapter B with respect to a deficiency described in this paragraph shall not preclude or be precluded by any other notice, proceeding, or determination with respect to a partner's tax liability for a taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule in case of assertion by partner's spouse of innocent spouse relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding section 6404(b), if the spouse of a partner asserts that section 6013(e) applies with respect to a liability that is attributable to any adjustment to a partnership item (including any liability for any penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts relating to such adjustment), then such spouse may file with the Secretary within 60 days after the notice of computational adjustment is mailed to the spouse a request for abatement of the assessment specified in such notice. Upon receipt of such request, the Secretary shall abate the assessment. Any reassessment of the tax with respect to which an abatement is made under this subparagraph shall be subject to the deficiency procedures prescribed by subchapter B. The period for making any such reassessment shall not expire before the expiration of 60 days after the date of such abatement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the spouse files a petition with the Tax Court pursuant to section 6213 with respect to the request for abatement described in subparagraph (A), the Tax Court shall only have jurisdiction pursuant to this section to determine whether the requirements of section 6013(e) have been satisfied. For purposes of such determination, the treatment of partnership items (and the applicability of any penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts) under the settlement, the final partnership administrative adjustment, or the decision of the court (whichever is appropriate) that gave rise to the liability in question shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Rules similar to the rules contained in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (2) shall apply for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Mathematical and clerical errors appearing on partnership return</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a partner if, within 60 days after the day on which notice of the correction of the error is mailed to the partner, such partner files with the Secretary a request that the correction not be made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Claims arising out of erroneous computations, etc.</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A partner may file a claim for refund on the grounds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary erroneously computed any computational adjustment necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to make the partnership items on the partner's return consistent with the treatment of the partnership items on the partnership return, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to apply to the partner a settlement, a final partnership administrative adjustment, or the decision of a court in an action brought under section 6226 or section 6228(a),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary failed to allow a credit or to make a refund to the partner in the amount of the overpayment attributable to the application to the partner of a settlement, a final partnership administrative adjustment, or the decision of a court in an action brought under section 6226 or section 6228(a), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the day on which the decision of the court becomes final.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Suit if claim not allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any portion of a claim under paragraph (1) is not allowed, the partner may bring suit with respect to such portion within the period specified in subsection (a) of section 6532 (relating to periods of limitations on refund suits).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No review of substantive issues</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of any claim or suit under this subsection, the treatment of partnership items on the partnership return, under the settlement, under the final partnership administrative adjustment, or under the decision of the court (whichever is appropriate) shall be conclusive. In addition, the determination under the final partnership administrative adjustment or under the decision of the court (whichever is appropriate) concerning the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount which relates to an adjust<!-- PDFPage:2674 -->ment to a partnership item shall also be conclusive.

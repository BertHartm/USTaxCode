<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subpart, the term &ldquo;adverse party&rdquo; means any person having a substantial beneficial interest in the trust which would be adversely affected by the exercise or nonexercise of the power which he possesses respecting the trust. A person having a general power of appointment over the trust property shall be deemed to have a beneficial interest in the trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nonadverse party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subpart, the term &ldquo;nonadverse party&rdquo; means any person who is not an adverse party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Related or subordinate party</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subsection (f) and sections 674 and 675, a related or subordinate party shall be presumed to be subservient to the grantor in respect of the exercise or nonexercise of the powers conferred on him unless such party is shown not to be subservient by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rule where power is subject to condition precedent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person shall be considered to have a power described in this subpart even though the exercise of the power is subject to a precedent giving of notice or takes effect only on the expiration of a certain period after the exercise of the power.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Subpart not to result in foreign ownership</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, this subpart shall apply only to the extent such application results in an amount (if any) being currently taken into account (directly or through 1 or more entities) under this chapter in computing the income of a citizen or resident of the United States or a domestic corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Certain revocable and irrevocable trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any portion of a trust if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the power to revest absolutely in the grantor title to the trust property to which such portion is attributable is exercisable solely by the grantor without the approval or consent of any other person or with the consent of a related or subordinate party who is subservient to the grantor, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the only amounts distributable from such portion (whether income or corpus) during the lifetime of the grantor are amounts distributable to the grantor or the spouse of the grantor.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Recharacterization of purported gifts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any transfer directly or indirectly from a partnership or foreign corporation which the transferee treats as a gift or bequest, the Secretary may recharacterize such transfer in such circumstances as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special rule where grantor is foreign person</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time when contributions deemed made</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a taxpayer shall be deemed to have made a payment of a contribution on the last day of a taxable year if the payment is on account of that taxable year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for that taxable year (including extensions thereof).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:565 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contributions to be in cash or certain other items</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be allowed as a depreciation deduction a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear (including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) of property used in the trade or business, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) of property held for the production of income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Cross reference</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For determination of depreciation deduction in case of property to which section 168 applies, see section 168.</strong></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Basis for depreciation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis on which exhaustion, wear and tear, and obsolescence are to be allowed in respect of any property shall be the adjusted basis provided in section 1011, for the purpose of determining the gain on the sale or other disposition of such property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for property subject to lease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any property is acquired subject to a lease&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no portion of the adjusted basis shall be allocated to the leasehold interest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the entire adjusted basis shall be taken into account in determining the depreciation deduction (if any) with respect to the property subject to the lease.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Life tenants and beneficiaries of trusts and estates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of property held by one person for life with remainder to another person, the deduction shall be computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property and shall be allowed to the life tenant. In the case of property held in trust, the allowable deduction shall be apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the trustee in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the instrument creating the trust, or, in the absence of such provisions, on the basis of the trust income allocable to each. In the case of an estate, the allowable deduction shall be apportioned between the estate and the heirs, legatees, and devisees on the basis of the income of the estate allocable to each.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Certain term interests not depreciable</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No depreciation deduction shall be allowed under this section (and no depreciation or amortization deduction shall be allowed under any other provision of this subtitle) to the taxpayer for any term interest in property for any period during which the remainder interest in such property is held (directly or indirectly) by a related person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Coordination with other provisions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, but for this subsection, a depreciation or amortization deduction would be allowable to the taxpayer with respect to any term interest in property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the taxpayer's basis in such property shall be reduced by any depreciation or amortization deductions disallowed under this subsection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the basis of the remainder interest in such property shall be increased by the amount of such disallowed deductions (properly adjusted for any depreciation deductions allowable under subsection (d) to the taxpayer).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Denial of increase in basis of remainderman</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No increase in the basis of the remainder interest shall be made under paragraph (3)(B) for any disallowed deductions attributable to periods during which the term interest was held&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by an organization exempt from tax under this subtitle, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation but only if income <!-- PDFPage:472 -->from the term interest is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Coordination with subsection (d)</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the income from the property to be taken into account in determining the depreciation deduction under such method shall be equal to the amount of income earned in connection with the property before the close of the 10th taxable year following the taxable year in which the property was placed in service,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the adjusted basis of the property shall only include amounts with respect to which the requirements of section 461(h) are satisfied,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the depreciation deduction under such method for the 10th taxable year beginning after the taxable year in which the property was placed in service shall be equal to the adjusted basis of such property as of the beginning of such 10th taxable year, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an estimate of the future income to be earned in connection with such property for periods after the recomputation year and before the close of the 10th taxable year following the taxable year in which the property was placed in service,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, determining (solely for purposes of computing such interest) the overpayment or underpayment of tax for each such prior taxable year which would result solely from the application of subparagraph (A), and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, any cost incurred after the property is placed in service (which is not treated as a separate property under paragraph (5)) shall be taken into account by discounting (using the Federal mid-term rate determined under section 1274(d) as of the time such cost is incurred) such cost to its value as of the date the property is placed in service.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Any costs incurred after the property is placed in service and before the close of such 10th taxable year if such costs are significant and give rise to a significant increase in the income from the property which was not included in the estimated income from the property.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Syndication income from television series</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of property which is 1 or more episodes in a television series, income from syndicating such series shall not be required to be taken into account under this subsection before the earlier of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Collection of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subtitle F (other than sections 6654 and 6655), any interest required to be paid by the taxpayer under paragraph (1) for any recomputation year shall be treated as an increase in the tax imposed by this chapter for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (2), determinations of the amount of income earned in connection with any property shall be made in the same manner as for purposes of applying the income forecast method; except that any income from the disposition of such property shall be taken into account.</p>

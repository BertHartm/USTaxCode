<h3 class="section-head">Rule 217. Disposition of Actions for Declaratory Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General:</strong> Disposition of an action for declaratory judgment, which does not involve either a revocation or the status of a governmental obligation, will ordinarily be made on the basis of the administrative record, as defined in Rule 210(b)(10). Only with the permission of the Court, upon good cause shown, will any party be permitted to introduce before the Court any evidence other than that presented before the Internal Revenue Service and contained in the administrative record as so defined. Disposition of an action for declaratory judgment involving a revocation may be made on the basis of the administrative record alone only where the parties agree that such record contains all the relevant facts and that such facts are not in dispute. Disposition of a governmental obligation action will be made on the basis of the administrative record, augmented by additional evidence to the extent that the Court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedure:</strong> (1) <em>Disposition on the Administrative Record:</em> The Court expects that, within 30 days after service of the answer, the parties will file with the Court the entire administrative record (or so much thereof as either party may deem necessary for a complete disposition of the action for declaratory judgment), stipulated as to its genuineness. If, however, the parties are unable to file such a stipulated administrative record, then, not sooner than 30 days nor later than 45 days after service of the answer, the Commissioner shall file with the Court the entire administrative record, as defined in Rule 210(b)(10), appropriately certified as to its genuineness by the Commissioner or by an official authorized to act for the Commissioner in such situation. See Rule 212, as to the time and place for submission of the action to the Court. The Court will thereafter issue an opinion and declaratory judgment in the action. Except in a case involving a revocation or the status of a governmental obligation, the Court's decision will be based upon the assumption that the facts as represented in the administrative record as so stipulated or so certified are true and upon any additional facts as found by the Court if the Court deems that a trial is necessary. In the case of a revocation or a governmental obligation action, the Court may, upon the basis of the evidence presented, make findings of fact which differ from the administrative record. In the case of a governmental obligation action, see the last sentence of paragraph (a) of this Rule. See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Other Dispositions Without Trial:</em> In addition, an action for declaratory judgment may be decided on a motion for a judgment on the pleadings under Rule 120 or on a motion for summary judgment under Rule 121 or such an action may be submitted at any time by notice of the parties filed with the Court in accordance with Rule 122.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Disposition Where Trial is Required:</em> Whenever a trial is required in an action for declaratory judgment, such trial shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules contained in Title XIV, except as otherwise provided in this Title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Burden of Proof:</strong> The burden of proof in declaratory judgment actions shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Retirement Plan Actions:</em> (A) <em>Parties Petitioner:</em> In all cases, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner as to jurisdictional requirements. The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner, and upon any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, as to those grounds set forth in the respondent's notice of determination that a retirement plan does not qualify. If the respondent has determined that a retirement plan does qualify, then the petitioner, and any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to every ground on which each such party relies to sustain such party's position that such plan does not qualify. If the Commissioner has failed to issue a notice of determination, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the petitioner who contends that the retirement plan does qualify, and any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to the jurisdictional requirements described in Rule 210(c) and also with respect to the date on which the request for determination, if any, was mailed to the Internal Revenue Service and the office to which it was mailed, and that the notice of determination has been issued by the Commissioner; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the petitioner who contends that the retirement plan does not qualify, and any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to the matters set forth in subparagraph (1)(A)(i) of this paragraph (c) and also as to the grounds and supporting facts on which each such party relies for such party's claim that the plan does not qualify.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <em>Parties Respondent:</em> The burden of proof shall be upon the respondent, and upon any party joining or intervening on the respondent's side, as to any ground not stated in the notice of determination upon which either relies to sustain the respondent's determination that a retirement plan does not qualify. If the respondent has not issued a notice of determination, then the respondent, and any party joining or intervening on the respondent's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to every ground upon which either relies to sustain the position that such plan does not qualify. See also subparagraph (1)(A)(ii) of this paragraph (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Other Actions:</em> (A) <em>Petitioner:</em> The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner as to jurisdictional requirements and as to the grounds set forth in the notice of determination. If the Commissioner has failed to issue a notice of determination, then the burden of proof shall be on the petitioner with respect to jurisdictional requirements, and also with respect to the date on which the request for determination, if any, was mailed to the Internal Revenue Service and the office to which it was mailed, and that no notice of determination has been issued by the Commissioner.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:45 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <em>Respondent:</em> The burden of proof shall be upon the respondent as to any ground upon which the respondent relies and which is not stated in the notice of determination. If the respondent has not issued a notice of determination, then the respondent shall bear the burden of proof as to every ground relied upon to sustain the respondent's position, other than those matters as to which the burden is on the petitioner under subparagraph (2)(A) of this paragraph (c) where such a notice is not issued.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an annuity contract is purchased&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for an employee by an employer described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for an employee (other than an employee described in clause (i)), who performs services for an educational organization described in section 170(b)(1) (A)(ii), by an employer which is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in the case of a contract purchased under a salary reduction agreement, the contract meets the requirements of section 401(a)(30),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then amounts contributed by such employer for such annuity contract on or after such rights become nonforfeitable shall be excluded from the gross income of the employee for the taxable year to the extent that the aggregate of such amounts does not exceed the exclusion allowance for such taxable year.

For purposes of applying the rules of this subsection to amounts contributed by an employer for a taxable year, amounts transferred to a contract described in this paragraph by reason of a rollover contribution described in paragraph (8) of this subsection or section 408(d)(3)(A)(iii) shall not be considered contributed by such employer.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Number of years of service for duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed ministers or lay employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection and section 415(c)(4)(A)&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Amounts paid treated as contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this title, amounts paid by an employer described in paragraph (1)(A) to a custodial account which satisfies the requirements of section 401(f)(2) shall be treated as amounts contributed by him for an annuity contract for his employee if&mdash;</p>

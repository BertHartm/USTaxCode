<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition by tax matters partner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 90 days after the day on which a notice of a final partnership administrative adjustment is mailed to the tax matters partner, the tax matters partner may file a petition for a readjustment of the partnership items for such taxable year with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Tax Court,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the district court of the United States for the district in which the partnership's principal place of business is located, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Petition by partner other than tax matters partner</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the tax matters partner does not file a readjustment petition under subsection (a) with respect to any final partnership administrative adjustment, any notice partner (and any 5-percent group) may, within 60 days after the close of the 90-day period set forth in subsection (a), file a petition for a readjustment of the partnership items for the taxable year involved with any of the courts described in subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Priority of the Tax Court action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If more than 1 action is brought under paragraph (1) with respect to any partnership for any partnership taxable year, the first such action brought in the Tax Court shall go forward.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Priority outside the Tax Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If more than 1 action is brought under paragraph (1) with respect to any partnership for any taxable year but no such action is brought in the Tax Court, the first such action brought shall go forward.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Dismissal of other actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an action is brought under paragraph (1) in addition to the action which goes forward under paragraph (2) or (3), such action shall be dismissed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Tax matters partner may intervene</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tax matters partner may intervene in any action brought under this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2451 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Partners treated as parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an action is brought under subsection (a) or (b) with respect to a partnership for any partnership taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) each person who was a partner in such partnership at any time during such year shall be treated as a party to such action, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the court having jurisdiction of such action shall allow each such person to participate in the action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Partner must have interest in outcome</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In order to be party to action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (c) shall not apply to a partner after the day on which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the partnership items of such partner for the partnership taxable year became nonpartnership items by reason of 1 or more of the events described in subsection (b) of section 6231, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period within which any tax attributable to such partnership items may be assessed against that partner expired.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) To file petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No partner may file a readjustment petition under subsection (b) unless such partner would (after the application of paragraph (1) of this subsection) be treated as a party to the proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Jurisdictional requirement for bringing action in district court or Court of Federal Claims</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A readjustment petition under this section may be filed in a district court of the United States or the Court of Federal Claims only if the partner filing the petition deposits with the Secretary, on or before the day the petition is filed, the amount by which the tax liability of the partner would be increased if the treatment of partnership items on the partner's return were made consistent with the treatment of partnership items on the partnership return, as adjusted by the final partnership administrative adjustment. In the case of a petition filed by a 5-percent group, the requirement of the preceding sentence shall apply to each member of the group. The court may by order provide that the jurisdictional requirements of this paragraph are satisfied where there has been a good faith attempt to satisfy such requirements and any shortfall in the amount required to be deposited is timely corrected.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Refund on request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an action brought in a district court of the United States or in the Court of Federal Claims is dismissed by reason of the priority of a Tax Court action under paragraph (2) of subsection (b), the Secretary shall, at the request of the partner who made the deposit, refund the amount deposited under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Interest payable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount deposited under paragraph (1), while deposited, shall not be treated as a payment of tax for purposes of this title (other than chapter 67).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Scope of judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A court with which a petition is filed in accordance with this section shall have jurisdiction to determine all partnership items of the partnership for the partnership taxable year to which the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment relates and the proper allocation of such items among the partners.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Determination of court reviewable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any determination by a court under this section shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court or a final judgment or decree of the district court or the Court of Federal Claims, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. With respect to the partnership, only the tax matters partner, a notice partner, or a 5-percent group may seek review of a determination by a court under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Effect of decision dismissing action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an action brought under this section is dismissed (other than under paragraph (4) of subsection (b)), the decision of the court dismissing the action shall be considered as its decision that the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment is correct, and an appropriate order shall be entered in the records of the court.</p>

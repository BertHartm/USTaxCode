<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nonrecognition property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of the property permitted to be received under such section without the recognition of gain or loss shall be the same as that of the property exchanged&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) decreased by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the fair market value of any other property (except money) received by the taxpayer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of any money received by the taxpayer, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, then in making the allocation under paragraph (1) of this subsection, there shall be taken into account not only the property so permitted to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also the stock or securities (if any) of the distributing corporation which are retained, and the allocation of basis shall be made among all such properties.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:744 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Section 355 transactions which are not exchanges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, a distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies shall be treated as an exchange, and for such purposes the stock and securities of the distributing corporation which are retained shall be treated as surrendered, and received back, in the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assumption of liability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where, as part of the consideration to the taxpayer, another party to the exchange assumed a liability of the taxpayer or acquired from the taxpayer property subject to a liability, such assumption or acquisition (in the amount of the liability) shall, for purposes of this section, be treated as money received by the taxpayer on the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definition of nonrecognition property in case of section 361 exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the property permitted to be received under section 361 without the recognition of gain or loss shall be treated as consisting only of stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Adjustments in intragroup transactions involving section 355</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies and which involves the distribution of stock from 1 member of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a) without regard to subsection (b) thereof) to another member of such group, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, provide adjustments to the adjusted basis of any stock which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is in a corporation which is a member of such group, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is held by another member of such group,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">to appropriately reflect the proper treatment of such distribution.</p>

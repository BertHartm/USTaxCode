<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any reasonable charges (other than mortality charges) which (on the basis of the company's experience, if any, with respect to similar contracts) are reasonably expected to be actually paid, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the maturity date, including the date on which any benefit described in subparagraph (C) is payable, shall be deemed to be no earlier than the day on which the insured attains age 95, and no later than the day on which the insured attains age 100,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the death benefits shall be deemed to be provided until the maturity date determined by taking into account subparagraph (B), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the amount of any endowment benefit (or sum of endowment benefits, including any cash surrender value on the maturity date determined by taking into account subparagraph (B)) shall be deemed not to exceed the least amount payable as a death benefit at any time under the contract.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2890 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limited increases in death benefit permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for purposes of computing the guideline level premium, an increase in the death benefit which is provided in the contract may be taken into account but only to the extent necessary to prevent a decrease in the excess of the death benefit over the cash surrender value of the contract,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for purposes of the cash value accumulation test, the increase described in subparagraph (A) may be taken into account if the contract will meet such test at all times assuming that the net level reserve (determined as if level annual premiums were paid for the contract over a period not ending before the insured attains age 95) is substituted for the net single premium, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for purposes of the cash value accumulation test, the death benefit increases may be taken into account if the contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) has an initial death benefit of $5,000 or less and a maximum death benefit of $25,000 or less,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides for a fixed predetermined annual increase not to exceed 10 percent of the initial death benefit or 8 percent of the death benefit at the end of the preceding year, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (C), the initial death benefit of a contract shall be determined by treating all contracts issued to the same contract owner as 1 contract.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of certain premiums returned to policyholder</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, in order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(2)(A), any portion of any premium paid during any contract year is returned by the insurance company (with interest) within 60 days after the end of a contract year, the amount so returned (excluding interest) shall be deemed to reduce the sum of the premiums paid under the contract during such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Interest returned includible in gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 72(e), the amount of any interest returned as provided in subparagraph (B) shall be includible in the gross income of the recipient.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The payment of a premium which would result in the sum of the premiums paid exceeding the guideline premium limitation shall be disregarded for purposes of subsection (a)(2) if the amount of such premium does not exceed the amount necessary to prevent the termination of the contract on or before the end of the contract year (but only if the contract will have no cash surrender value at the end of such extension period).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If there is a change in the benefits under (or in other terms of) the contract which was not reflected in any previous determination or adjustment made under this section, there shall be proper adjustments in future determinations made under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the change referred to in subparagraph (B)(ii) occurs during the 5-year period beginning on the issue date of the contract, the recapture ceiling is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a contract to which subsection (a)(1) applies, the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the cash surrender value of the contract, immediately before the reduction, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the net single premium (determined under subsection (b)), immediately after the reduction, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a contract to which subsection (a)(2) applies, the greater of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Treatment of certain distributions made in anticipation of benefit reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, subparagraph (B) shall apply also to any distribution made in anticipation of a reduction in benefits under the contract. For purposes of the preceding sentence, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the provisions of subparagraphs (C) and (D); and any distribution which reduces the cash surrender value of a contract and which is made within 2 years before a reduction in benefits under the contract shall be treated as made in anticipation of such reduction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Correction of errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that&mdash;</p>

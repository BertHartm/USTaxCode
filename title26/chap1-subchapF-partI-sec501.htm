<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such benefits are payable to employees under a classification which is set forth in the plan and which is found by the Secretary not to be discriminatory in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such benefits do not discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)).

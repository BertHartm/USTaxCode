<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Joinder in Retirement Plan Action:</strong> The joinder of parties in retirement plan actions shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Permissive Joinder:</em> Any person who, under Code Section 7476(b)(1), is entitled to commence an action for declaratory judgment with respect to the qualification of a retirement plan may join in filing a petition with any other such person in such an action with respect to the same plan. If the Commissioner has issued a notice of determination with respect to the qualification of the plan, then any person joining in the petition must do so within the period specified in Code Section 7476(b)(5). If more than one petition is filed with respect to the qualification of the same retirement plan, then see Rule 141 (relating to the possibility of consolidating the actions with respect to the plan).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Joinder of Additional Parties:</em> Any party to an action for declaratory judgment with respect to the qualification of a retirement plan may move to have joined in the action any employer who established or maintains the plan, plan administrator, or any person in whose absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties. Unless otherwise permitted by the Court, any such motion must be filed not later than 30 days after joinder of issue (see Rule 214). Such motion shall be served on the parties to the action (other than the movant). See Rule 21(b). The movant shall cause personal service to be made on each person sought to be joined by a United States marshal or by a deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age, who shall make a return of service, see Form 13, Appendix I. Such return of service shall be filed with the motion, but failure to do so or otherwise to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service. Unless otherwise permitted by the Court, any objection to such motion shall be filed within 30 days after the service of the motion. The motion will be granted whenever the Court finds that in the interests of justice such person should be joined. If the motion is granted, such person will thereupon become a party to the action, and the Court will enter such orders as it deems appropriate as to further pleading and other matters. See Rule 50(b) with respect to actions on motions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Nonjoinder of Necessary Parties:</em> If the Court determines that any person described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is a necessary party to an action for declaratory judgment and that such person has not been joined, then the Court may, on its own motion or on the motion of any party or any such person, dismiss the action on the ground that the absent person is necessary and that justice cannot be accomplished in the absent person's absence, or direct that any such person be made a party to the action. An order dismissing a case for nonjoinder of a necessary party may be conditional or absolute.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Joinder of Parties in Exempt Organization and in Governmental Obligation Actions:</strong> Joinder of parties is not permitted in an exempt organization action or in a governmental obligation action. See Code Sections 7428(b)(1) and 7478(b)(1). With respect to consolidation of actions, see Rule 141.</p>

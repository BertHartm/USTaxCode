<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualified funeral trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified funeral trust&rdquo; means any trust (other than a foreign trust) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the trust arises as a result of a contract with a person engaged in the trade or business of providing funeral or burial services or property necessary to provide such services,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the sole purpose of the trust is to hold, invest, and reinvest funds in the trust and to use such funds solely to make payments for such services or property for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the only beneficiaries of such trust are individuals with respect to whom such services or property are to be provided at their death under contracts described in paragraph (1),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the only contributions to the trust are contributions by or for the benefit of such beneficiaries,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the trustee elects the application of this subsection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the trust would (but for the election described in paragraph (5)) be treated as owned under subpart E by the purchasers of the contracts described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Dollar limitation on contributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualified funeral trust&rdquo; shall not include any trust which accepts aggregate contributions by or for the benefit of an individual in excess of $7,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Related trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), all trusts having trustees which are related persons shall be treated as 1 trust. For purposes of the preceding sentence, persons are related if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the relationship between such persons is described in section 267 or 707(b),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such persons are treated as a single employer under subsection (a) or (b) of section 52, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Secretary determines that treating such persons as related is necessary to prevent avoidance of the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inflation adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any contract referred to in subsection (b)(1) which is entered into during any calendar year after 1998, the dollar amount referred to paragraph (1) shall be increased by an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year, by substituting &ldquo;calendar year 1997&rdquo; for &ldquo;calendar year 1992&rdquo; in subparagraph (B) thereof.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of amounts refunded to purchaser on cancellation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain or loss shall be recognized to a purchaser of a contract described in subsection (b)(1) by reason of any payment from such trust to such purchaser by reason of cancellation of <!-- PDFPage:1262 -->such contract. If any payment referred to in the preceding sentence consists of property other than money, the basis of such property in the hands of such purchaser shall be the same as the trust's basis in such property immediately before the payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Simplified reporting</h4>

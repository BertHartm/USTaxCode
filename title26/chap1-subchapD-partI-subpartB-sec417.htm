<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan meets the requirements of section 401(a)(11) only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under the plan, each participant&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election, (ii) such election designates a beneficiary (or a form of benefits) which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the spouse expressly permits designations by the participant without any requirement of further consent by the spouse), and (iii) the spouse's consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Any consent by a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse may not be obtained) under the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to such spouse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Plan to provide written explanations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Explanation of joint and survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each plan shall provide to each participant, within a reasonable period of time before the annuity starting date (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe), a written explanation of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the participant's right to make, and the effect of, an election under paragraph (1) to waive the joint and survivor annuity form of benefit,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the rights of the participant's spouse under paragraph (2), and</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Applicable period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;applicable period&rdquo; means, with respect to a participant, whichever of the following periods ends last:</p>

<!-- PDFPage:889 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) A reasonable period after the individual becomes a participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) A reasonable period ending after paragraph (5) ceases to apply to the participant.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Requirement of spousal consent for using plan assets as security for loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each plan shall provide that, if section 401(a)(11) applies to a participant when part or all of the participant's accrued benefit is to be used as security for a loan, no portion of the participant's accrued benefit may be used as security for such loan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the spouse of the participant (if any) consents in writing to such use during the 90-day period ending on the date on which the loan is to be so secured, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which is the actuarial equivalent of a single annuity for the life of the participant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term also includes any annuity in a form having the effect of an annuity described in the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition of qualified preretirement survivor annuity</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;qualified preretirement survivor annuity&rdquo; means a survivor annuity for the life of the surviving spouse of the participant if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the payments to the surviving spouse under such annuity are not less than the amounts which would be payable as a survivor annuity under the qualified joint and survivor annuity under the plan (or the actuarial equivalent thereof) if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a participant who dies on or before the date on which the participant would have attained the earliest retirement age, such participant had&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) separated from service on the date of death,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) survived to the earliest retirement age,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) retired with an immediate qualified joint and survivor annuity at the earliest retirement age, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) died on the day after the day on which such participant would have attained the earliest retirement age, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under the plan, the earliest period for which the surviving spouse may receive a payment under such annuity is not later than the month in which the participant would have attained the earliest retirement age under the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of an individual who separated from service before the date of such individual's death, subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) shall not apply.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Security interests taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), any security interest held by the plan by reason of a loan outstanding to the participant shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the qualified preretirement survivor annuity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Survivor annuities need not be provided if participant and spouse married less than 1 year</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), a plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(11) merely because the plan provides that a qualified joint and survivor annuity (or a qualified preretirement survivor annuity) will not be provided unless the participant and spouse had been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the participant's annuity starting date, or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Plan may distribute benefit in excess of $3,500 only with consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>

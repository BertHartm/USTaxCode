<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any summons described in subsection (c), the provisions of subsections (a)(1) and (b) shall not apply if, upon petition by the Secretary, the court determines, on the basis of the facts and circumstances alleged, that there is reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice may lead to attempts to conceal, destroy, or alter records relevant to the examination, to prevent the communication of information from other persons through intimidation, bribery, or collusion, or to flee to avoid prosecution, testifying, or production of records.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Jurisdiction of district court; etc.</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may issue a certificate to the third-party recordkeeper that the period prescribed for beginning a proceeding to quash a summons has expired and that no such proceeding began within such period, or that the taxpayer consents to the examination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Protection for recordkeeper who discloses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any third-party recordkeeper, or agent or employee thereof, making a disclosure of records pursuant to this section in good-faith reliance on the certificate of the Secrtetary&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7609_1_target" name="7609_1">1</a></sup> or an order of a court requiring production of records shall not be liable to any customer or other person for such disclosure.</p>

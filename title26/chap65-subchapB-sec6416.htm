<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Condition to allowance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No credit or refund of any overpayment of tax imposed by chapter 31 (relating to retail excise taxes), or chapter 32 (manufacturers taxes), shall be allowed or made unless the person who paid the tax establishes, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, that he&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has not included the tax in the price of the article with respect to which it was imposed and has not collected the amount of the tax from the person who purchased such article;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has repaid the amount of the tax to the ultimate purchaser of the article;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of an overpayment under subsection (b)(2) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) has repaid or agreed to repay the amount of the tax to the ultimate vendor of the article, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) has obtained the written consent of such ultimate vendor to the allowance of the credit or the making of the refund; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) has filed with the Secretary the written consent of the person referred to in subparagraph (B) to the allowance of the credit or the making of the refund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the tax imposed by section 4041 (relating to tax on special fuels) on the use of any liquid, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an overpayment of tax under paragraph (1), (3)(A), (4), (5), or (6) of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, in any case in which the Secretary determines that an article is not taxable, the term &ldquo;ultimate purchaser&rdquo; (when used in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection) includes a wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer who, on the 15th day after the date of such determination, holds such article for sale; but only if claim for credit or refund by reason of this paragraph is filed on or before the date for filing the return with respect to the taxes imposed under chapter 32 for the first period which begins more than 60 days after the date on such determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Wholesale distributors to administer credits and refunds of gasoline tax</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, a wholesale distributor who purchases any gasoline on which tax imposed by section 4081 has been paid and who sells the gasoline to its ultimate purchaser shall be treated as the person (and the only person) who paid such tax.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Wholesale distributor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;wholesale distributor&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 4093(b)(2) (determined by substituting &ldquo;any gasoline taxable under section 4081&rdquo; for &ldquo;aviation fuel&rdquo; therein).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special cases in which tax payments considered overpayments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, credit or refund (without interest) shall be allowed or made in respect of the overpayments determined under the following paragraphs:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2513 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Price readjustments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B) or (C), if the price of any article in respect of which a tax, based on such price, is imposed by chapter 32 or by section 4051, is readjusted by reason of the return or repossession of the article or a covering or container, or by a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance, including a readjustment for local advertising (but only to the extent provided in section 4216(e)(2) and (3)), the part of the tax proportionate to the part of the price repaid or credited to the purchaser shall be deemed to be an overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Further manufacture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of an article in respect of which tax was computed under section 4223(b)(2); but if the price for which such article was sold is readjusted by reason of the return or repossession of the article, the part of the tax proportionate to the part of such price repaid or credited to the purchaser shall be deemed to be an overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustment of tire price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No credit or refund of any tax imposed by subsection (a) or (b) of section 4071 shall be allowed or made by reason of an adjustment of a tire pursuant to a warranty or guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specified uses and resales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tax paid under chapter 32 (or under subsection (a) or (d) of section 4041 in respect of sales or under section 4051) in respect of any article shall be deemed to be an overpayment if such article was, by any person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) exported;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) used or sold for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) sold to a State or local government for the exclusive use of a State or local government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) sold to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in the case of any tire taxable under section 4071(a), sold to any person for use as described in section 4221(e)(3); or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Subparagraphs (C) and (D) shall not apply in the case of any tax paid under section 4064. In the case of the tax imposed by section 4131, subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) shall not apply and subparagraph (A) shall apply only if the use of the exported vaccine meets such requirements as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe. This paragraph shall not apply in the case of any tax imposed under section 4041(a)(1) or 4081 on diesel fuel and any tax paid under section 4091 or 4121.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Tax-paid articles used for further manufacture, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the tax imposed by chapter 32 has been paid with respect to the sale of any article (other than coal taxable under section 4121) by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof and such article is sold to a subsequent manufacturer or producer before being used, such tax shall be deemed to be an overpayment by such subsequent manufacturer or producer if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of any article other than any fuel taxable under section 4081 or 4091, such article is used by the subsequent manufacturer or producer as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) another article taxable under chapter 32, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an automobile bus chassis or an automobile bus body,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">manufactured or produced by him; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any fuel taxable under section 4081 or 4091, such fuel is used by the subsequent manufacturer or producer, for nonfuel purposes, as a material in the manufacture or production of any other article manufactured or produced by him.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such tire is sold by any person on or in connection with, or with the sale of, any other article, such tax shall be deemed to be an overpayment by such person if such other article is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by such person exported, sold to a State or local government for the exclusive use of a State or local government, sold to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use, or used or sold for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) tax was paid under section 4216(e)(1) in respect of any installment account,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such account is, under the agreement under which the account was sold, returned to the person who sold such account, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the consideration is readjusted as provided in such agreement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the part of the tax paid under section 4216(e)(1) allocable to the part of the consideration repaid or credited to the purchaser of such account shall be deemed to be an overpayment.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such tax shall be deemed to be an overpayment by such person. For purposes of the pre<!-- PDFPage:2514 -->ceding sentence, an article shall be treated as having been used as a component part of another article if, had it not been broken or rendered useless in the manufacture or production of such other article, it would have been so used.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This subsection shall apply in respect of an article only if the exportation or use referred to in the applicable provision of this subsection occurs before any other use, or, in the case of a sale or resale, the use referred to in the applicable provision of this subsection is to occur before any other use.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Credit on returns</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Accounting procedures for like articles</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) on a last-in-first-out basis, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in accordance with any other consistent method approved by the Secretary.</p>

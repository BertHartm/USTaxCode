If the Commissioner shall be without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an allegation, then the Commissioner shall so state, and such statement shall have the effect of a denial. If the Commissioner intends to qualify or to deny only a part of an allegation, then the Commissioner shall specify so much of it as is true and shall qualify or deny only the remainder. In addition, the answer shall contain a clear and concise statement of every ground, together with the facts in support thereof on which the Commissioner relies and has the burden of proof. Paragraphs of the answer shall be designated to correspond to those of the petition to which they relate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Effect of Answer:</em> Every material allegation set out in the petition and not expressly admitted or denied in the answer shall be deemed to be admitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Reply:</strong> Each petitioner may file a reply or move with respect to the answer within 20 days from the date of service of the answer. Where a reply is filed, every affirmative allegation set out in the answer and not expressly admitted or denied in the reply, shall be deemed to be admitted. Where a reply is not filed, the affirmative allegations in the answer will be deemed denied. Any new material contained in the reply shall be deemed denied.</p>

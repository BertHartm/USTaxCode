<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) foreclosure property,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any asset&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) any regular interest in a REMIC.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Debt issued by holder of ownership interest not permitted asset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;permitted asset&rdquo; shall not include any debt instrument issued by the holder of the ownership interest in the FASIT or by any person related to such holder or any direct or indirect interest in such a debt instrument. The preceding sentence shall not apply to cash equivalents and to any other investment specified in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Foreclosure property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Taxable transfers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A tax, computed as provided in section 2502, is hereby imposed for each calendar year on the transfer of property by gift during such calendar year by any individual resident or nonresident.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transfers of intangible property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), paragraph (1) shall not apply to the transfer of intangible property by a nonresident not a citizen of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Certain individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Paragraph (2) shall not apply in the case of a donor who, within the 10-year period ending with the date of transfer, lost United States citizenship, unless such loss did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes under this subtitle or subtitle A.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain individuals treated as having tax avoidance purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), an individual shall be treated as having a principal purpose to avoid such taxes if such individual is so treated under section 877(a)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exception for certain individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to a decedent meeting the requirements of section 877(c)(1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Credit for foreign gift taxes</h4>

<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For comparable treatment of long-term lawful permanent residents who ceased to be taxed as residents, see section 877(e).</strong></p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary establishes that it is reasonable to believe that an individual's loss of United States citizenship would, but for paragraph (3), result in a substantial reduction for the calendar year in the taxes on the transfer of property by gift, the burden of proving that such loss of citizenship did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes under this subtitle or subtitle A shall be on such individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Transfers to political organizations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A donor who is a citizen of the United States and a resident of a possession thereof shall, for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, be considered a &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; of the United States within the meaning of that term wherever used in this title unless he acquired his United States citizenship solely by reason of (1) his being a citizen of such possession of the United States, or (2) his birth or residence within such possession of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certain residents of possessions considered nonresidents not citizens of the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A donor who is a citizen of the United States and a resident of a possession thereof shall, for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, be considered a &ldquo;nonresident not a citizen of the United States&rdquo; within the meaning of that term wherever used in this title, but only if such donor acquired his United States citizenship solely by reason of (1) his being a citizen of such possession of the United States, or (2) his birth or residence within such possession of the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Consolidation:</strong> When cases involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the Court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue, it may order all the cases consolidated, and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay or duplication. Similar action may be taken where cases involve different tax liabilities of the same parties, notwithstanding the absence of a common issue. Unless otherwise permitted by the Court for good cause shown, a motion to consolidate cases may be filed only after all the cases sought to be consolidated have become at issue. The caption of a motion to consolidate shall include all of the names and docket numbers of the cases sought to be consolidated arranged in chronological order (i.e., the oldest case first). Unless otherwise ordered, the caption of all documents subsequently filed in consolidated cases shall include all of the docket numbers arranged in chronological order, but may include only the name of the oldest case with an appropriate indication of other parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Separate Trials:</strong> The Court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition or economy, may order a separate trial of any one or more claims or defenses or issues, or of the tax liability of any party or parties. The Court may enter appropriate orders or decisions with respect to any such claims, defenses, issues, or parties that are tried separately. As to severance of parties or claims, see Rule 61(b).</p>

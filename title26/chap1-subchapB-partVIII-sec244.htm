<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a corporation, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount computed as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) First determine the amount received as dividends on the preferred stock of a public utility which is subject to taxation under this chapter and with respect to which the deduction provided in section 247 for dividends paid is allowable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Then multiply the amount determined under paragraph (1) by the fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the numerator of which is 14 percent, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the denominator of which is that percentage which equals the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Finally ascertain the amount which is 70 percent of the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount determined under paragraph (1), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount determined under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subsection (a) shall be applied separately to such qualifying dividends, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for purposes of subsection (a)(3), the percentage applicable to such qualifying dividends shall be 100 percent in lieu of 70 percent.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Consent by the Tax Matters Partner to Entry of Decision:</strong> A stipulation consenting to entry of decision executed by the tax matters partner and filed with the Court shall bind all parties. The signature of the tax matters partner constitutes a certificate by the tax matters partner that no party objects to entry of decision. See Rule 251.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Settlement or Consistent Agreements Entered Into by All Participating Partners or No Objection by Participating Partners:</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After the expiration of the time within which to file a notice of election to intervene or to participate under Rule 245(a) or (b), the Commissioner shall move for entry of decision, and shall submit a proposed form of decision with such motion, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all of the participating partners have entered into a settlement agreement or consistent agreement with the Commissioner, or all of such partners do not object to the granting of the Commissioner's motion for entry of decision, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the tax matters partner (if a participating partner) agrees to the proposed decision in the case but does not certify that no party objects to the granting of the Commissioner's motion for entry of decision.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 3 days from the date on which the Commissioner's motion for entry of decision is filed with the Court, the Commissioner shall serve on the tax matters partner a certificate showing the date on which the Commissioner's motion was filed with the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 3 days after receiving the Commissioner's certificate, the tax matters partner shall serve on all other parties to the action other than the participating partners, a copy of the Commissioner's motion for entry of decision, a copy of the proposed decision, a copy of the Commissioner's certificate showing the date on which the Commissioner's motion was filed with the Court, and a copy of this Rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any party objects to the granting of the Commissioner's motion for entry of decision, then that party shall, within 60 days from the date on which the Commissioner's motion was filed with the Court, file a motion for leave to file a notice of election to intervene or to participate, accompanied by a separate notice of election to intervene or a separate notice of election to participate, as the case may be. If no such motion is filed with the Court within such period, or if the Court should deny such motion, then the Court may enter the proposed decision as its decision in the partnership action. See Code Sections 6226(f) and 6228(a)(5). See also Rule 245, relating to intervention and participation, and Rule 251, relating to decisions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Other Settlement and Consistent Agreements:</strong> If a settlement agreement or consistent agreement is not within the scope of paragraph (b) of this Rule, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a participating partner, the Commissioner shall promptly file with the Court a notice of settlement agreement or notice of consistent agreement, whichever may be appropriate, that identifies the participating partner or partners who have entered into the settlement agreement or consistent agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of any partner who enters into a settlement agreement, the Commissioner <!-- PDFPage:54 -->shall, within 7 days after the settlement agreement is executed by both the partner and the Commissioner, serve on the tax matters partner a statement which sets forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the identity of the party or parties to the settlement agreement and the date of the agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the year or years to which the settlement agreement relates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the terms of settlement as to each partnership item and the allocation of such items among the partners. Within 7 days after receiving the statement required by this subparagraph, the tax matters partner shall serve a copy of the statement on all parties to the action.</p>

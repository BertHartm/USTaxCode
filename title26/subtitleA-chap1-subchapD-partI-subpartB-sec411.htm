<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under section 401(a) unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that an employee's right to his normal retirement benefit is nonforfeitable upon the attainment of normal retirement age (as defined in paragraph (8)) and in addition satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (11) of this subsection and the requirements of subsection (b)(3), and also satisfies, in the case of a defined benefit plan, the requirements of subsection (b)(1) and, in the case of a defined contribution plan, the requirements of subsection (b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Employee contributions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Forfeiture on account of death</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that it is not payable if the participant dies (except in the case of a survivor annuity which is payable as provided in section 401(a)(11)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Suspension of benefits upon reemployment of retiree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that the payment of benefits is suspended for such period as the employee is employed, subsequent to the commencement of payment of such benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a plan other than a multi-employer plan, by the employer who maintains the plan under which such benefits were being paid; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, in the same industry, the same trade or craft, and the same geographic area covered by the plan as when such benefits commenced.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Withdrawal of mandatory contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) A right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that, in the case of a participant who does not have a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of his accrued benefit derived from employer contributions, such accrued benefit may be forfeited on account of the withdrawal by the participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from mandatory contributions (as defined in subsection (c)(2)(C)) made by such participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply to a plan unless the plan provides that any accrued benefit forfeited under a plan provision described in such clause shall be restored upon repayment by the participant of the full amount of the withdrawal described in such clause plus, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest. Such interest shall <!-- PDFPage:899 -->be computed on such amount at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) on the date of such repayment (computed annually from the date of such withdrawal). The plan provision required under this clause may provide that such repayment must be made (I) in the case of a withdrawal on account of separation from service, before the earlier of 5 years after the first date on which the participant is subsequently re-employed by the employer, or the close of the first period of 5 consecutive 1-year breaks in service commencing after the withdrawal; or (II) in the case of any other withdrawal, 5 years after the date of the withdrawal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) In the case of accrued benefits derived from employer contributions which accrued before September 2, 1974, a right to such accrued benefit derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that an amount of such accrued benefit may be forfeited on account of the withdrawal by the participant of an amount attributable to the benefit derived from mandatory contributions (as defined in subsection (c)(2)(C)) made by such participant before September 2, 1974 if such amount forfeited is proportional to such amount withdrawn. This clause shall not apply to any plan to which any mandatory contribution is made after September 2, 1974. The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this clause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, in the case of any class-year plan, a withdrawal of employee contributions shall be treated as a withdrawal of such contributions on a plan year by plan year basis in succeeding order of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) For nonforfeitability where the employee has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of his accrued benefit, see section 401(a)(19).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Cessation of contributions under a multiemployer plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions under a multiemployer plan shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that benefits accrued as a result of service with the participant's employer before the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan may not be payable if the employer ceases contributions to the multiemployer plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Reduction and suspension of benefits by a multiemployer plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A participant's right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions under a multiemployer plan shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A matching contribution (within the meaning of section 401(m)) shall not be treated as forfeitable merely because such contribution is forfeitable if the contribution to which the matching contribution relates is treated as an excess contribution under section 401(k)(8)(B), an excess deferral under section 402(g)(2)(A), or an excess aggregate contribution under section 401(m)(6)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Service included in determination of nonforfeitable percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In computing the period of service under the plan for purposes of determining the nonforfeitable percentage under paragraph (2), all of an employee's years of service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan shall be taken into account, except that the following may be disregarded:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A defined benefits plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date on which any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) First two years of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;years of service&rdquo; has the meaning provided by section 410(a)(3)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Certain insured defined benefit plans</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, an employee's benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee's benefit accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Certain limitations permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (without regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustments under plan for delayed retirement taken into account</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of inservice distribution of benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has not commenced as of the end of such year in accordance with section 401(a)(14)(C), and the payment of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee is not suspended during such plan year pursuant to subsection (a)(3)(B), then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of any adjustment in the benefit payable under the plan during such plan year attributable to the delay in the distribution of benefits after the attainment of normal retirement age.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;The preceding provisions of this clause shall apply in accordance with regulations of the Secretary. Such regulations may provide for the application of the preceding provisions of this clause, in the case of any such employee, with respect to any period of time within a plan year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Disregard of subsidized portion of early retirement benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Coordination with other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall provide by regulation for the coordination of the requirements of this subparagraph with the requirements of subsection (a), sections 404, 410, and 415, and the provisions of this subchapter precluding discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee's account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee's account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of the defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee's accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for each employee's accrued benefit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Year of participation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining an employee's accrued benefit, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under section 410(a)(5), determined without regard to section 410(a)(5)(E)) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor which provide for the calculation of such period on any reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Less than full time service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee's service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Less than 1,000 hours of service during year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis solely because such service is not taken into account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee's contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee's contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Defined benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee's accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 417(e)(3) (as of the determination date).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there has been a pattern of abuse under the plan (such as a dismissal of employees before their accrued benefits become nonforfeitable) tending to discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been, or there is reason to believe there will be, an accrual of benefits or forfeitures tending to discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a plan to which section 412 does not apply, upon complete discontinuance of contributions under the plan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the rights of all affected employees to benefits accrued to the date of such termination, partial termination, or discontinuance, to the extent funded as of such date, or the amounts credited to the employees&rsquo; accounts, are nonforfeitable. This paragraph shall not apply to benefits or contributions which, under provisions of the plan adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to preclude the discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4), may not be used for designated employees in the event of early termination of the plan.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits voluntary employee contributions, the portion of an employee's accrued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this section if the accrued benefit of a participant is decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an <!-- PDFPage:906 -->amendment described in section 412(c)(8), or section 4281 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p>

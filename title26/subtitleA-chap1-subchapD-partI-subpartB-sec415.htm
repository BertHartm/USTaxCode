<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A trust which is a part of a pension, profitsharing, or stock bonus plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under section 401(a) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan provides for the payment of benefits with respect to a participant which exceed the limitation of subsection (b),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a defined contribution plan, contributions and other additions under the plan with respect to any participant for any taxable year exceed the limitation of subsection (c), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in any case in which an individual is a participant in both a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan maintained by the employer, the trust has been disqualified under subsection (g).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Section applies to certain annuities and accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an employee annuity plan described in section 403(a),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an annuity contract described in section 403(b), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a simplified employee pension described in section 408(k),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such a contract, plan, or pension shall not be considered to be described in section 403(a), 403(b), or 408(k), as the case may be, unless it satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), whichever is appropriate, and has not been disqualified under subsection (g). In the case of an annuity contract described in section 403(b), the preceding sentence shall apply only to the portion of the annuity contract which exceeds the limitation of subsection (b) or the limitation of subsection (c), whichever is appropriate, and the amount of the contribution for such portion shall reduce the exclusion allowance as provided in section 403(b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation for defined benefit plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Benefits with respect to a participant exceed the limitation of this subsection if, when expressed as an annual benefit (within the meaning of paragraph (2)), such annual benefit is greater than the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $90,000, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 100 percent of the participant's average compensation for his high 3 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual benefit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;annual benefit&rdquo; means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) under a plan to which employees do not contribute and under which no rollover contributions (as defined in sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), and 408(d)(3)) are made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment for certain other forms of benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the benefit under the plan is payable in any form other than the form described in subparagraph (A), or if the employees contribute to the plan or make rollover contributions (as defined in sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), and 408(d)(3)), the determinations as to whether the limitation described in paragraph (1) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary by adjusting such benefit so that it is equivalent to the benefit described in subparagraph (A). For purposes of this subparagraph, any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits shall not be taken into account; and that portion of any joint and survivor annuity which constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity (as defined in section 417) shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustment to $90,000 limit where benefit begins before the social security retirement age</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the retirement income benefit under the plan begins before the social security retirement age, the determination as to whether the $90,000 limitation set forth in paragraph (1)(A) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by reducing the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) so that such limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $90,000 annual benefit beginning at the social security retirement age. The reduction under this subparagraph shall be made in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe which is consistent with the reduction for old-age insurance benefits commencing before the social security retirement age under the Social Security Act.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Adjustment to $90,000 limit where benefit begins after the social security retirement age</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the retirement income benefit under the plan begins after the social security retirement age, the determination as to whether the $90,000 limitation set forth in paragraph (1)(A) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by increasing the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) so that such limitation (as so increased) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $90,000 annual benefit beginning at the social security retirement age.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Limitation on certain assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For purposes of adjusting any limitation under subparagraph (C) and, except as provided in clause (ii), for purposes of adjusting any benefit under subparagraph (B), the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the greater of 5 percent or the rate specified in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of adjusting any benefit under subparagraph (B) for any form of bene<!-- PDFPage:952 -->fit subject to section 417(e)(3), the applicable interest rate (as defined in section 417(e)(3)) shall be substituted for &ldquo;5 percent&rdquo; in clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For purposes of adjusting any limitation under subparagraph (D), the interest rate assumption shall not be greater than the lesser of 5 percent or the rate specified in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) For purposes of this subsection, no adjustments under subsection (d)(1) shall be taken into account before the year for which such adjustment first takes effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) For purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), the mortality table used shall be the table prescribed by the Secretary. Such table shall be based on the prevailing commissioners&rsquo; standard table (described in section 807(d)(5)(A)) used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts issued on the date the adjustment is being made (without regard to any other subparagraph of section 807(d)(5)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Plans maintained by governments and tax-exempt organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d)), a plan maintained by an organization (other than a governmental unit) exempt from tax under this subtitle, or a qualified merchant marine plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subparagraph (C) shall be applied&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) by substituting &ldquo;age 62&rdquo; for &ldquo;social security retirement age&rdquo; each place it appears, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) as if the last sentence thereof read as follows: &ldquo;The reduction under this subparagraph shall not reduce the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) below (i) $75,000 if the benefit begins at or after age 55, or (ii) if the benefit begins before age 55, the equivalent of the $75,000 limitation for age 55.&rdquo;, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) subparagraph (D) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;age 65&rdquo; for &ldquo;social security retirement age&rdquo; each place it appears.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified merchant marine plan&rdquo; means a plan in existence on January 1, 1986, the participants in which are merchant marine officers holding licenses issued by the Secretary of Transportation under title 46, United States Code.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Special limitation for qualified police or firefighters</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) as a full-time employee of any police department or fire department which is organized and operated by the State or political subdivision maintaining such defined benefit plan to provide police protection, firefighting services, or emergency medical services for any area within the jurisdiction of such State or political subdivision, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(I) Exemption for survivor and disability benefits provided under governmental plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (C) of this paragraph and paragraph (5) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a participant's high 3 years shall be the period of consecutive calendar years (not more than 3) during which the participant both was an active participant in the plan and had the greatest aggregate compensation from the employer. In the case of an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting for &ldquo;compensation from the employer&rdquo; the following: &ldquo;the participant's earned income (within the meaning of section 401(c)(2) but determined without regard to any exclusion under section 911)&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Total annual benefits not in excess of $10,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, the benefits payable with respect to a participant under any defined benefit plan shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of this subsection if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an employee who has less than 10 years of participation in a defined benefit plan, the limitation referred to in paragraph (1)(A) shall be the limitation determined under such paragraph (without regard to this paragraph) multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:953 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the defined benefit plan of the employer, and</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any overpayment, the Secretary, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit the amount of such overpayment, including any interest allowed thereon, against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the person who made the overpayment and shall, subject to subsections (c), (d), and (e), refund any balance to such person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Credits against estimated tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations providing for the crediting against the estimated income tax for any taxable year of the amount determined by the taxpayer or the Secretary to be an overpayment of the income tax for a preceding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Offset of past-due support against overpayments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any overpayment to be refunded to the person making the overpayment shall be reduced by the amount of any past-due support (as defined in section 464(c) of the Social Security Act) owed by that person of which the Secretary has been notified by a State in accordance with section 464 of the Social Security Act. The Secretary shall remit the amount by which the overpayment is so reduced to the State collecting such support and notify the person making the overpayment that so much of the overpayment as was necessary to satisfy his obligation for past-due support has been paid to the State. A reduction under this subsection shall be applied first to satisfy any past-due support which has been assigned to the State under section 402(a)(26) or 471(a)(17) of the Social Security Act, and shall be applied to satisfy any other past-due support after any other reductions allowed by law (but before a credit against future liability for an internal revenue tax) have been made. This subsection shall be applied to an overpayment prior to its being credited to a person's future liability for an internal revenue tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Collection of debts owed to Federal agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receiving notice from any Federal agency that a named person owes a past-due legally enforceable debt (other than past-due support subject to the provisions of subsection (c)) to such agency, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reduce the amount of any overpayment payable to such person by the amount of such debt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pay the amount by which such overpayment is reduced under subparagraph (A) to such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) notify the person making such overpayment that such overpayment has been reduced by an amount necessary to satisfy such debt.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Priorities for offset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any overpayment by a person shall be reduced pursuant to this subsection after such overpayment is reduced pursuant to subsection (c) with respect to past-due support collected pursuant to an assignment under section 402(a)(26) of the Social Security Act and before such overpayment is credited to the future liability for tax of such person pursuant to subsection (b). If the Secretary receives notice from a Federal agency or agencies of more than one debt subject to paragraph (1) that is owed by a person to such agency or agencies, any overpayment by such person shall be applied against such debts in the order in which such debts accrued.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of OASDI overpayments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to an OASDI overpayment only if the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 3720A(f) of title 31, United States Code, are met with respect to such overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice; protection of other persons filing joint return</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a debt consisting of an OASDI overpayment, if the Secretary determines upon receipt of the notice referred to in paragraph (1) that the refund <!-- PDFPage:2599 -->from which the reduction described in paragraph (1)(A) would be made is based upon a joint return, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) notify each taxpayer filing such joint return that the reduction is being made from a refund based upon such return, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) include in such notification a description of the procedures to be followed, in the case of a joint return, to protect the share of the refund which may be payable to another person.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Adjustments based on protections given to other taxpayers on joint return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the other person filing a joint return with the person owing the OASDI overpayment takes appropriate action to secure his or her proper share of the refund subject to reduction under this subsection, the Secretary shall pay such share to such other person. The Secretary shall deduct the amount of such payment from amounts which are derived from subsequent reductions in refunds under this subsection and are payable to a trust fund referred to in subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Deposit of amount of reduction into appropriate trust fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In lieu of payment, pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), of the amount of any reduction under this subsection to the Commissioner of Social Security, the Secretary shall deposit such amount in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, whichever is certified to the Secretary as appropriate by the Commissioner of Social Security.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) OASDI overpayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;OASDI overpayment&rdquo; means any overpayment of benefits made to an individual under title II of the Social Security Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Collection of overpayments under title IV&ndash;A of the Social Security Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any overpayment to be refunded to the person making the overpayment shall be reduced (after reductions pursuant to subsections (c) and (d), but before a credit against future liability for an internal revenue tax) in accordance with section 405(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6402_1_target" name="6402_1">1</a></sup> of the Social Security Act (concerning recovery of overpayments to individuals under State plans approved under part A of title IV of such Act).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Review of reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to hear any action, whether legal or equitable, brought to restrain or review a reduction authorized by subsection (c) or (d). No such reduction shall be subject to review by the Secretary in an administrative proceeding. No action brought against the United States to recover the amount of any such reduction shall be considered to be a suit for refund of tax. This subsection does not preclude any legal, equitable, or administrative action against the Federal agency to which the amount of such reduction was paid or any such action against the Commissioner of Social Security which is otherwise available with respect to recoveries of overpayments of benefits under section 204 of the Social Security Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Federal agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;Federal agency&rdquo; means a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, and includes a Government corporation (as such term is defined in section 103 of title 5, United States Code).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Treatment of payments to States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may provide that, for purposes of determining interest, the payment of any amount withheld under subsection (c) to a State shall be treated as a payment to the person or persons making the overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Cross reference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For procedures relating to agency notification of the Secretary, see section 3721 of title 31, United States Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Refunds to certain fiduciaries of insolvent members of affiliated groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of an insolvent corporation which is a member of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return for any taxable year and which is subject to a statutory or court-appointed fiduciary, the Secretary may by regulation provide that any refund for such taxable year may be paid on behalf of such insolvent corporation to such fiduciary to the extent that the Secretary determines that the refund is attributable to losses or credits of such insolvent corporation.</p>

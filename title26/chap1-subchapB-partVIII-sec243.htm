<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;qualifying dividend&rdquo; means any dividend received by a corporation&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such dividend is distributed out of the earnings and profits of a taxable year of the distributing corporation which ends after December 31, 1963, for which an election under section 1562 was not in effect, and on each day of which the distributing corporation and the corporation receiving the dividend were members of such affiliated group, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such dividend is paid by a corporation with respect to which an election under section 936 is in effect for the taxable year in which such dividend is paid.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effect of election</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for purposes of this subsection, a distribution by any member of such group which is subject to tax under section 801 shall not be treated as a qualifying dividend if such distribution is out of earnings and profits for a taxable year for which an election under this paragraph is not effective and for which such distributing corporation was not a component member of a controlled group of corporations within the meaning of section 1563 solely by reason of section 1563(b)(2)(D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this paragraph shall be made by the common parent of the affiliated group and at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe. Any such election shall be binding on all members of such group and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subsections (a)(3) and (b)(2) of section 244,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;80 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;70 percent&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 20-percent owned corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;20-percent owned corporation&rdquo; means any corporation if 20 percent or more of the stock of such corporation (by vote and value) is owned by the taxpayer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, stock described in section 1504(a)(4) shall not be taken into account.</p>

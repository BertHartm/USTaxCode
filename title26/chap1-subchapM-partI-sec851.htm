<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, the term &ldquo;regulated investment company&rdquo; means any domestic corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which, at all times during the taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 to 80b&ndash;2) as a management company or unit investment trust, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has in effect an election under such Act to be treated as a business development company, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1246 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which is a common trust fund or similar fund excluded by section 3(c)(3) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;3(c)) from the definition of &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; and is not included in the definition of &ldquo;common trust fund&rdquo; by section 584(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A corporation shall not be considered a regulated investment company for any taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it files with its return for the taxable year an election to be a regulated investment company or has made such election for a previous taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at least 90 percent of its gross income is derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans (as defined in section 512(a)(5)), and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities (as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures, or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or currencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) less than 30 percent of its gross income is derived from the sale or disposition of any of the following which was held for less than 3 months:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) stock or securities (as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) options, futures, or forward contracts (other than options, futures, or forward contracts on foreign currencies), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) foreign currencies (or options, futures, or forward contracts on foreign currencies) but only if such currencies (or options, futures, or forward contracts) are not directly related to the company's principal business of investing in stock or securities (or options and futures with respect to stocks or securities), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) at the close of each quarter of the taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at least 50 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) cash and cash items (including receivables), Government securities and securities of other regulated investment companies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) other securities for purposes of this calculation limited, except and to the extent provided in subsection (e), in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater in value than 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the taxpayer and to not more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities (other than Government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or of two or more issuers which the taxpayer controls and which are determined, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraph (2), there shall be treated as dividends amounts included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) or 1293(a) for the taxable year to the extent that, under section 959(a)(1) or 1293(c) (as the case may be), there is a distribution out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year which are attributable to the amounts so included. For purposes of paragraph (2), the Secretary may by regulation exclude from qualifying income foreign currency gains which are not directly related to the company's principal business of investing in stock or securities (or options and futures with respect to stock or securities). For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3), amounts excludable from gross income under section 103(a) shall be treated as included in gross income. Income derived from a partnership or trust shall be treated as described in paragraph (2) only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership or trust (as the case may be) which would be described in paragraph (2) if realized by the regulated investment company in the same manner as realized by the partnership or trust. In the case of the taxable year in which a regulated investment company is completely liquidated, there shall not be taken into account under paragraph (3) any gain from the sale, exchange, or distribution of any property after the adoption of the plan of complete liquidation.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1247 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) All other terms shall have the same meaning as when used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A corporation which meets the requirements of subsections (b)(4) and (c) at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a regulated investment company because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A corporation which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a regulated investment company if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.</p>

The preceding sentence shall not apply to the securities of an issuer if the investment company has continuously held any security of such issuer (or of any predecessor company of such issuer as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) for 10 or more years preceding such quarter of such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall not apply at the close of any quarter of a taxable year to an investment company if at the close of such quarter more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by securities of issuers with respect to each of which the investment company holds more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and in respect of each of which or any predecessor thereof the investment company has continuously held any security for 10 or more years preceding such quarter unless the value of its total assets so represented is reduced to 25 percent or less within 30 days after the close of such quarter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of status</h4>

For purposes of the certification under this subsection, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall have authority to issue such rules, regulations and orders, and to conduct such investigations and hearings, either public or private, as it may deem appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each holder of an interest in such trust shall, to the extent of such interest, be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets of such trust;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the basis of the assets of such trust which are treated under subparagraph (A) as being owned by a holder of an interest in <!-- PDFPage:1248 -->such trust shall be the same as the basis of his interest in such trust; and</p>

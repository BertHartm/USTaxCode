<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A statement describing the nature of any dispute within the purview of Code Section 7481(d). If no such dispute exists, then a statement to that effect and a proposed form of decision shall be submitted with the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) If the petitioner requests an evidentiary or other hearing on the motion, then a statement of the reasons why the motion cannot be disposed of by the Court without a hearing.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Response by Commissioner in Unagreed Case:</strong> If a dispute exists between the parties regarding either the petitioner's right to relief under Code Section 7481(d) or the amount of interest deductible as an administrative expense under Code Section 2053, then the Commissioner shall, within 60 days after service of a motion filed pursuant to this Rule, file a written response. The response shall identify the nature of the dispute, shall specifically admit or deny each allegation set forth in the petitioner's motion, and shall state the Commissioner's position in respect of each disputed matter. If the Commissioner agrees with the petitioner's request for a hearing, or if the Commissioner requests a hearing, then the response shall include a statement of the Commissioner's reasons why the motion cannot be disposed of without a hearing. If the Commissioner opposes the petitioner's request for a hearing, then the response shall include a statement of the reasons why no hearing is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Disposition of Motion:</strong> A motion to modify a decision filed pursuant to this Rule will ordinarily be disposed of without an evidentiary or other hearing unless it is clear from the motion and the Commissioner's written response that there is a bona fide factual dispute that cannot be resolved without an evidentiary hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Recognition of Counsel:</strong> Counsel recognized by the Court in the action in which the Court entered the decision which the petitioner now seeks to modify will be recognized in a proceeding commenced under this Rule.

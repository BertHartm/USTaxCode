<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice of seizure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As soon as practicable after seizure of property, notice in writing shall be given by the Secretary to the owner of the property (or, in the case of personal property, the possessor thereof), or shall be left at his usual place of abode or business if he has such within the internal revenue district where the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located, or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to his last known address. Such notice shall specify the sum demanded and shall contain, in the case of personal property, an account of the property seized and, in the case of real property, a de<!-- PDFPage:2488 -->scription with reasonable certainty of the property seized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall as soon as practicable after the seizure of the property give notice to the owner, in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), and shall cause a notification to be published in some newspaper published or generally circulated within the county wherein such seizure is made, or if there be no newspaper published or generally circulated in such county, shall post such notice at the post office nearest the place where the seizure is made, and in not less than two other public places. Such notice shall specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale thereof. Whenever levy is made without regard to the 10-day period provided in section 6331(a), public notice of sale of the property seized shall not be made within such 10-day period unless section 6336 (relating to sale of perishable goods) is applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sale of indivisible property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any property liable to levy is not divisible, so as to enable the Secretary by sale of a part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax and expenses, the whole of such property shall be sold.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time and place of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The time of sale shall not be less than 10 days nor more than 40 days from the time of giving public notice under subsection (b). The place of sale shall be within the county in which the property is seized, except by special order of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Manner and conditions of sale</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determinations relating to minimum price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the sale of property seized by levy, the Secretary shall determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a minimum price for which such property shall be sold (taking into account the expense of making the levy and conducting the sale), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether, on the basis of criteria prescribed by the Secretary, the purchase of such property by the United States at such minimum price would be in the best interest of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Sale to highest bidder at or above minimum price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, at the sale, one or more persons offer to purchase such property for not less than the amount of the minimum price, the property shall be declared sold to the highest bidder.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Property deemed sold to United States at minimum price in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If no person offers the amount of the minimum price for such property at the sale and the Secretary has determined that the purchase of such property by the United States would be in the best interest of the United States, the property shall be declared to be sold to the United States at such minimum price.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Release to owner in other cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, at the sale, the property is not declared sold under subparagraph (B) or (C), the property shall be released to the owner thereof and the expense of the levy and sale shall be added to the amount of tax for the collection of which the levy was made. Any property released under this subparagraph shall remain subject to any lien imposed by subchapter C.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional rules applicable to sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall by regulations prescribe the manner and other conditions of the sale of property seized by levy. If one or more alternative methods or conditions are permitted by regulations, the Secretary shall select the alternatives applicable to the sale. Such regulations shall provide:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) That the sale shall not be conducted in any manner other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by public auction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by public sale under sealed bids.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In the case of the seizure of several items of property, whether such items shall be offered separately, in groups, or in the aggregate; and whether such property shall be offered both separately (or in groups) and in the aggregate, and sold under whichever method produces the highest aggregate amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Whether the announcement of the minimum price determined by the Secretary may be delayed until the receipt of the highest bid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Whether payment in full shall be required at the time of acceptance of a bid, or whether a part of such payment may be deferred for such period (not to exceed 1 month) as may be determined by the Secretary to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The extent to which methods (including advertising) in addition to those prescribed in subsection (b) may be used in giving notice of the sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Under what circumstances the Secretary may adjourn the sale from time to time (but such adjournments shall not be for a period to exceed in all 1 month).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment of amount bid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If payment in full is required at the time of acceptance of a bid and is not then and there paid, the Secretary shall forthwith proceed to again sell the property in the manner provided in this subsection. If the conditions of the sale permit part of the payment to be deferred, and if such part is not paid within the prescribed period, suit may be instituted against the purchaser for the purchase price or such part thereof as has not been paid, together with interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum from the date of the sale; or, in the discretion of the Secretary, the sale may be declared by the Secretary to be null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price and the property may again be advertised and sold as provided in subsections (b) and (c) and this subsection. In the event of such readvertisement and sale any new purchaser shall receive such property or rights to property, free and <!-- PDFPage:2489 -->clear of any claim or right of the former defaulting purchaser, of any nature whatsoever, and the amount paid upon the bid price by such defaulting purchaser shall be forfeited.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Right to request sale of seized property within 60 days</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner of any property seized by levy may request that the Secretary sell such property within 60 days after such request (or within such longer period as may be specified by the owner). The Secretary shall comply with such request unless the Secretary determines (and notifies the owner within such period) that such compliance would not be in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Stay of sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For restrictions on sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision, see section 6863(b)(3).</strong></p>

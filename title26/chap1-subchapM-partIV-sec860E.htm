<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Excess inclusions may not be offset by net operating losses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the taxable income of any holder of a residual interest in a REMIC for any taxable year shall in no event be less than the excess inclusion for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for certain financial institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any organization to which section 593 applies. The Secretary may by regulations provide that the preceding sentence shall not apply where necessary or appropriate to prevent avoidance of tax imposed by this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for affiliated groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All members of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return shall be treated as 1 taxpayer for purposes of this subsection, except that paragraph (2) shall be applied separately with respect to each corporation which is a member of such group and to which section 593 applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of certain subsidiaries</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, a corporation to which section 593 applies and each qualified subsidiary of such corporation shall be treated as a single corporation to which section 593 applies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified subsidiary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified subsidiary&rdquo; means any corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) all the stock of which, and substantially all the indebtedness of which, is held directly by the corporation to which section 593 applies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) which is organized and operated exclusively in connection with the organization and operation of 1 or more REMIC's.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Coordination with section 172</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any excess inclusion for any taxable year shall not be taken into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in determining under section 172 the amount of any net operating loss for such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in determining taxable income for such taxable year for purposes of the 2nd sentence of section 172(b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Organizations subject to unrelated business tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the holder of any residual interest in a REMIC is an organization subject to the tax imposed by section 511, the excess inclusion of such holder for any taxable year shall be treated as unrelated business taxable income of such holder for purposes of section 511.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Excess inclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;excess inclusion&rdquo; means, with respect to any residual interest in a REMIC for any calendar quarter, the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the sum of the daily accruals with respect to such interest for days during such calendar quarter while held by such holder.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">To the extent provided in regulations, if residual interests in a REMIC do not have significant value, the excess inclusions with respect to such interests shall be the amount determined under subparagraph (A) without regard to subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of daily accruals</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the daily accrual with respect to any residual interest for any day in any calendar quarter shall be determined by allocating to each day in such quarter its ratable portion of the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the adjusted issue price of such interest at the beginning of such quarter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 120 percent of the long-term Federal rate (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each calendar quarter and properly adjusted for the length of such quarter).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjusted issue price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the adjusted issue price of any residual interest at the beginning of any calendar quarter is the issue price of the residual interest (adjusted for contributions)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) decreased (but not below zero) by any distribution made with respect to such in<!-- PDFPage:1282 -->terest before the beginning of such quarter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of residual interests held by real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a residual interest in a REMIC is held by a real estate investment trust, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the aggregate excess inclusions determined with respect to such interests, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the real estate investment trust taxable income (within the meaning of section 857(b)(2), excluding any net capital gain),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be allocated among the shareholders of such trust in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders from such trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any amount allocated to a shareholder under paragraph (1) shall be treated as an excess inclusion with respect to a residual interest held by such shareholder.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Rules similar to the rules of the preceding sentence shall apply also in the case of regulated investment companies, common trust funds, and organizations to which part I of subchapter T applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tax imposed by paragraph (1) on any transfer shall be paid by the transferor; except that, where such transfer is through an agent for a disqualified organization, such tax shall be paid by such agent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The person (otherwise liable for any tax imposed by paragraph (1)) shall be relieved of liability for the tax imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to any transfer if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the transferee furnishes to such person an affidavit that the transferee is not a disqualified organization, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as of the time of the transfer, such person does not have actual knowledge that such affidavit is false.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, at any time during any taxable year of a pass-thru entity, a disqualified organization is the record holder of an interest in such entity, there is hereby imposed on such entity for such taxable year a tax equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount of excess inclusions for such taxable year allocable to the interest held by such disqualified organization, multiplied by</p>

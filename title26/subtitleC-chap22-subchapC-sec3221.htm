<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Tier 1 tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to other taxes, there is hereby imposed on every employer an excise tax, with respect to having individuals in his employ, equal to the applicable percentage of compensation paid during any calendar year by such employer for services rendered to such employer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;applicable percentage&rdquo; means the percentage equal to the sum of the rates of tax in effect under subsections (a) and (b) of section 3111 for the calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Tier 2 tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to other taxes, there is hereby imposed on every employer an excise tax, with respect to having individuals in his employ, equal to 16.10 percent of the compensation paid during any calendar year by such employer for services rendered to such employer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In addition to other taxes, there is hereby imposed on every employer an excise tax, with respect to having individuals in his employ, for each man-hour for which compensation is paid by such employer for services rendered to him during any calendar quarter, at such rate as will make available sufficient funds to meet the obligation to pay supplemental annuities at the level provided under section 3(j) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 as in effect on December 31, 1974 and administrative expenses in connection therewith. For the purpose of this subsection, the Railroad Retirement Board is directed to determine what rate is required for each calendar quarter. The Railroad Retirement Board shall make the determinations provided for not later than fifteen days before each calendar quarter. As soon as practicable after each determination of the rate, as provided in this subsection, the Railroad Retirement Board shall publish a notice in the Federal Register, and shall advise all employers, employee representatives, and the Secretary, of the rate so determined. With respect to daily, weekly, or monthly rates of compensation such tax shall apply to the number of hours comprehended in the rate together with the number of overtime hours for which compensation in addition to the daily, weekly, or monthly rate is paid. With respect to compensation paid on a mileage or piecework basis such tax shall apply to the number of hours constituting the hourly equivalent of the compensation paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Each employer of employees whose supplemental annuities are reduced pursuant to section 3(j)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 or section 2(h)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this subsection an amount equivalent in each month to the aggregate amount of reductions in supplemental annuities accruing in such month to employees of such employer. If the credit so allowed to such an employer for any month exceeds the tax liability of such employer accruing under this subsection in such month, the excess may be carried forward for credit against such taxes accruing in subsequent months but the total credit allowed by this paragraph to an employer shall not exceed the total of the taxes on such employer imposed by this subsection. At the end of each calendar quarter the Railroad Retirement Board shall certify to the Secretary with respect to each such employer the amount of credit accruing to such employer under this paragraph during such quarter and shall notify such employer as to the amount so certified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the tax imposed by such subsection (c) shall not apply to an employer with respect to employees who are covered by a supplemental pension plan which is established pursuant to an agreement reached through collective bargaining between the employer and employees. There is hereby imposed on every such employer an excise tax equal to the amount of the supplemental annuity paid to each such employee under section 2(b) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, plus a percentage thereof determined by the Railroad Retirement Board to be sufficient to cover the admin<!-- PDFPage:2042 -->istrative costs attributable to such payments under section 2(b) of such Act.</p>

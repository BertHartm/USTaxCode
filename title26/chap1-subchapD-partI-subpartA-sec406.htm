<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such American employer has entered into an agreement under section 3121(<em>l</em>) which applies to the foreign affiliate of which such individual is an employee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the plan of such American employer expressly provides for contributions or benefits for individuals who are citizens or residents of the United States and who are employees of its foreign affiliates to which an agreement entered into by such American employer under section 3121(<em>l</em>) applies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) contributions under a funded plan of deferred compensation (whether or not a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a)) are not provided by any other person with respect to the remuneration paid to such individual by the foreign affiliate.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nondiscrimination requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of applying section 401(a)(4) and section 410(b) with respect to an individual who is treated as an employee of an American employer under subsection (a)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the determination of whether such individual is a highly compensated employee (as so defined) shall be made by treating such individual's total compensation (determined with the application of paragraph (2) of this subsection) as compensation paid by such American employer and by determining such individual's status with regard to such American employer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of applying paragraph (5) of section 401(a) with respect to an individual who is treated as an employee of an American employer under subsection (a)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such individual shall be treated as having paid the amount paid by such American employer which is equivalent to the tax imposed by section 3101.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of status as deemed employee not to be treated as separation from service for purposes of limitation of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of applying section 402(d) with respect to an individual who is treated as an employee of an American employer under subsection (a), such individual shall not be considered as separated from the service of such American employer solely by reason of the fact that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the agreement entered into by such American employer under section 3121(<em>l</em>) which covers the employment of such individual is terminated under the provisions of such section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such individual becomes an employee of a foreign affiliate with respect to which such agreement does not apply,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such individual ceases to be an employee of the foreign affiliate by reason of which he is treated as an employee of such American employer, if he becomes an employee of another entity in which such American employer has not less than a 10-percent interest (within the meaning of section 3121(<em>l</em>)(6)(B)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the provision of the plan described in subsection (a)(2) is terminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deductibility of contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of applying section 404 with respect to contributions made to or under a pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or annuity plan by an American employer, or by another taxpayer which is entitled to deduct its contributions under section 404(a)(3)(B), on behalf of an individual who is treated as an employee of such American employer under subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except as provided in paragraph (2), no deduction shall be allowed to such American employer or to any other taxpayer which is entitled to deduct its contributions under such sections,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there shall be allowed as a deduction to the foreign affiliate of which such individual is an employee an amount equal to the amount which (but for paragraph (1)) would be deductible under section 404 by the American employer if he were an employee of the American employer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any reference to compensation shall be considered to be a reference to the total compensation of such individual (determined with the application of subsection (b)(2)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any amount deductible by a foreign affiliate under this subsection shall be deductible for its taxable year with or within which the taxable year of such American employer ends.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment as employee under related provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An individual who is treated as an employee of an American employer under subsection (a) shall also be treated as an employee of such American employer, with respect to the plan described in subsection (a)(2), for purposes of applying the following provisions of this title:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Section 72(f) (relating to special rules for computing employees&rsquo; contributions).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Imposition of tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a trust (or another trust to which the property is distributed) sells or exchanges property at a gain not more than 2 years after the date of the initial transfer of the property in trust by the transferor, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the fair market value of such property at the time of the initial transfer in trust by the transferor exceeds the adjusted basis of such property immediately after such transfer,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">there is hereby imposed a tax determined in accordance with paragraph (2) on the includible gain recognized on such sale or exchange.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the tax imposed by paragraph (1) on any includible gain recognized on the sale or exchange of any property shall be equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the tax which would have been imposed under this chapter for the taxable year of the transferor in which the sale or exchange of such property occurs had the amount of the includible gain recognized on such sale or exchange, reduced by any deductions properly allocable to such gain, been included in the gross income of the transferor for such taxable year, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the tax actually imposed under this chapter for such taxable year on the transferor, plus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if such sale or exchange occurs in a taxable year of the transferor which begins after the beginning of the taxable year of the trust in which such sale or exchange occurs, an amount equal to the amount determined under subparagraph (A) multiplied by the underpayment rate established under section 6621.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The determination of tax under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) shall be made by not taking into account any carryback, and by not taking into account any loss or deduction to the extent that such loss or deduction may be carried by the transferor to any other taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Taxable year for which tax imposed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tax imposed by paragraph (1) shall be imposed for the taxable year of the trust which begins with or within the taxable year of the transferor in which the sale or exchange occurs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the excess of the fair market value of such property at the time of the initial transfer in trust by the transferor over the adjusted basis of such property immediately after such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Character of includible gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The character of the includible gain shall be determined as if the property had actually been sold or exchanged by the transferor, and any activities of the trust with respect to the sale or exchange of the property shall be deemed to be activities of the transferor, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the portion of the includible gain subject to the provisions of section 1245 and section 1250 shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Short sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the trust sells the property referred to in subsection (a) in a short sale within the 2-year period referred to in such subsection, such 2-year period shall be extended to the date of the closing of such short sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Substituted basis property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, in the case of any property held by the trust which has a basis determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of any other property which was transferred to the trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the initial transfer of such property in trust by the transferor shall be treated as having occurred on the date of the initial transfer in trust of such other property,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subsections (a)(1)(B) and (b)(2) shall be applied by taking into account the fair market value and the adjusted basis of such other property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount determined under subsection (b)(2) with respect to such other property shall be allocated (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) among such other property and all properties held by the trust which have a basis determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such other property.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1132 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to property&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subsection (a) (other than the 2-year requirement of paragraph (1)(A) thereof) shall be applied as if each installment were a separate sale or exchange of property to which such subsection applies, and</p>

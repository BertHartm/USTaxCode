<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a petition for a redetermination of a deficiency under section 6213(a) has been timely filed with the Tax Court before the making of an assessment or levy that is subject to the review procedures of this section, and 1 or more of the taxes and taxable periods before the Tax Court because of such petition is also included in the written statement that is provided to the taxpayer under subsection (a), then the Tax Court also shall have jurisdiction over any civil action for a determination under this subsection with respect to all the taxes and taxable periods included in such written statement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination by court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 20 days after a proceeding is commenced under paragraph (1), the court shall determine&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Order of court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court determines that the making of such levy is unreasonable, that the making of such assessment is unreasonable, or that the amount assessed or demanded is inappropriate, then the court may order the Secretary to release such levy, to abate such assessment, to redetermine (in whole or in part) the amount assessed or demanded, or to take such other action as the court finds appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of 20-day period where taxpayer so requests</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a civil action is filed under subsection (b) with the Tax Court and such court finds that there is want of jurisdiction because of the jurisdiction provisions of subsection (b)(2), then the Tax Court shall, if such court determines it is in the interest of justice, transfer the civil action to the district court in which the action could have been brought at the time such action was filed. Any civil action so transferred shall proceed as if such action had been filed in the district court to which such action is transferred on the date on which such action was actually filed in the Tax Court from which such action is transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Finality of determination</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reasonableness of levy, termination, or jeopardy assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a proceeding under subsection (b) involving the issue of whether the making of a levy described in subsection (a)(1) or the making of an assessment under section 6851, 6852, 6861, or 6862 is reasonable under the circumstances, the burden of proof in respect to such issue shall be upon the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Net operating loss carryforwards from C years allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1371(b)(1), any net operating loss carryforward arising in a taxable year for which the corporation was a C corporation shall be allowed for purposes of this section as a deduction against the net recognized built-in gain of the S corporation for the taxable year. For purposes of determining the amount of any such loss which may be carried to subsequent taxable years, the amount of the net recognized built-in gain shall be treated as taxable income. Rules similar to the rules of the preceding sentences of this paragraph shall apply in the case of a capital loss carryforward arising in a taxable year for which the corporation was a C corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of section 1201(a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be treated as if it were imposed by section 11, and</p>

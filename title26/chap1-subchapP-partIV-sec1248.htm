<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a United States person sells or exchanges stock in a foreign corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such person owns, within the meaning of section 958(a), or is considered as owning by applying the rules of ownership of section 958(b), 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such foreign corporation at any time during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange when such foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the gain recognized on the sale or exchange of such stock shall be included in the gross income of such person as a dividend, to the extent of the earnings and profits of the foreign corporation attributable (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to such stock which were accumulated in taxable years of such foreign corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and during the period or periods the stock sold or exchanged was held by such person while such foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of this section, a United States person shall be treated as having sold or exchanged any stock if, under any provision of this subtitle, such person is treated as realizing gain from the sale or exchange of such stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on tax applicable to individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual, if the stock sold or exchanged is a capital asset (within the meaning of section 1221) and has been held for more than 1 year, the tax attributable to an amount included in gross income as a dividend under subsection (a) shall not be greater than a tax equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a pro rata share of the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the taxes that would have been paid by the foreign corporation with respect to its income had it been taxed under this chapter as a domestic corporation (but without allowance for deduction of, or credit for, taxes described in subparagraph (B)), for the period or periods the stock sold or exchanged was held by the United States person in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, while the foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation, adjusted for distributions and amounts previously included in gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the income, war profits, or excess profits taxes paid by the foreign corporation with respect to such income; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount equal to the tax that would result by including in gross income, as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year, an amount equal to the excess of (A) the amount included in gross income as a dividend under subsection (a), over (B) the amount determined under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of earnings and profits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such person owned, within the meaning of section 958(a), or was considered as owning by applying the rules of ownership of section 958(b), 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such other foreign corporation at any time during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange when such other foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then, for purposes of this section, the earnings and profits of the foreign corporation the stock of which is sold or exchanged which are attributable to the stock sold or exchanged shall be deemed to include the earnings and profits of such other foreign corporation which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are attributable (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the stock of such other foreign corporation which such person owned within the meaning of section 958(a)(2) (by reason of his ownership within the meaning of section 958(a)(1)(A) of the stock sold or exchanged) on the date of such sale or exchange (or on the date of any sale or exchange of the stock of such other foreign corporation occurring during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange of the stock of such foreign corporation, to the extent not otherwise taken into account under this section but not in excess of the fair market value of the stock of such other foreign corporation sold or exchanged over the basis of such stock (for determining gain) in the hands of the transferor); and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">[(2) Repealed. Pub. L. 100&ndash;647, title I, &sect;1006(e)(14)(A), Nov. 10, 1988, 102 Stat. 3402]</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Foreign trade income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Earnings and profits of the foreign corporation attributable to foreign trade income of a FSC other than foreign trade income which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is section 923(a)(2) non-exempt income (within the meaning of section 927(d)(6)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) would not (but for section 923(a)(4)) be treated as exempt foreign trade income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the terms &ldquo;foreign trade income&rdquo; and &ldquo;exempt foreign trade income&rdquo; have the respective meanings given such terms by section 923.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Amounts included in gross income under section 1293</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Earnings and profits of the foreign corporation attributable to any amount previously included in the gross income of such person under section 1293 with respect to the stock sold or exchanged, but only to the extent the inclusion of such amount did not result in an exclusion of an amount under section 1293(c).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if&mdash;</p>

For purposes of subsections (c)(2), (d), and (h), a distribution of stock to which this subsection applies shall be treated as a sale of stock to which subsection (a) applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for certain distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any distribution of stock of a foreign corporation, paragraph (1) shall not apply if such distribution is to a domestic corporation&mdash;</p>

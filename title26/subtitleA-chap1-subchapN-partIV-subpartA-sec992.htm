<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the adjusted basis of the qualified export assets (as defined in section 993(b)) of the corporation at the close of the taxable year equals or exceeds 95 percent of the sum of the adjusted basis of all assets of the corporation at the close of the taxable year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such corporation does not have more than one class of stock and the par or stated value of its outstanding stock is at least $2,500 on each day of the taxable year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the corporation has made an election pursuant to subsection (b) to be treated as a DISC and such election is in effect for the taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such corporation is not a member of any controlled group of which a FSC is a member.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Status as DISC after having filed a return as a DISC</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations setting forth the conditions under and the extent to which a corporation which has filed a return as a DISC for a taxable year shall be treated as a DISC for such taxable year for all purposes of this title, notwithstanding the fact that the corporation has failed to satisfy the conditions of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Former DISC&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this title, the term &ldquo;former DISC&rdquo; means, with respect to any taxable year, a corporation which is not a DISC for such year but was a DISC in a preceding taxable year and at the beginning of the taxable year has undistributed previously taxed income or accumulated DISC income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Election</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An election by a corporation to be treated as a DISC shall be made by such corporation for a taxable year at any time during the 90&ndash;day period immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year, except that the Secretary may give his consent to the making of an election at such other times as he may designate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such election shall be made in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe and shall be valid only if all persons who are shareholders in such corporation on the first day of the first taxable year for which such election is effective consent to such election.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a corporation makes an election under paragraph (1), then the provisions of this part shall apply to such corporation for the taxable year of the corporation for which made and for all succeeding taxable years and shall apply to each person who at any time is a shareholder of such corporation for all periods on or after the first day of the first taxable year of the corporation for which the election is effective.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of election</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Revocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this subsection made by any corporation may be terminated by revocation of such election for any taxable year of the corporation after the first taxable year of the corporation for which the election is effective. A termination under this paragraph shall be effective with respect to such election&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for the taxable year in which made, if made at any time during the first 90 days of such taxable year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for the taxable year following the taxable year in which made, if made after the close of such 90 days,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">and for all succeeding taxable years of the corporation. Such termination shall be made in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe by regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Continued failure to be DISC</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a corporation is not a DISC for each of any 5 consecutive taxable years of the corporation for which an election under this subsection is effective, the election shall be terminated and not be in effect for any taxable year of the corporation after such 5th year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Distributions to meet qualification requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the conditions provided by paragraph (2), a corporation which for a taxable year does not satisfy a condition specified in paragraph (1)(A) (relating to gross receipts) or (1)(B) (relating to assets) of subsection (a) shall nevertheless be deemed to satisfy such condition for such year if it makes a pro rata distribution of property after the close of the taxable year to its shareholders (designated at the time of such distribution as a distribution to meet qualification requirements) with respect to their stock in an amount which is equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the condition of subsection (a)(1)(A) is not satisfied, the portion of such corporation's taxable income attributable to its gross receipts which are not qualified export receipts for such year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the condition of subsection (a)(1)(B) is not satisfied, the fair market value of those assets which are not qualified export assets on the last day of such taxable year, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1598 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if neither of such conditions is satisfied, the sum of the amounts required by subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reasonable cause for failure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The conditions under paragraph (1) shall be deemed satisfied in the case of a distribution made under such paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the failure to meet the requirements of subsection (a)(1)(A) or (B), and the failure to make such distribution prior to the date on which made, are due to reasonable cause; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the corporation pays, within the 30&ndash;day period beginning with the day on which such distribution is made, to the Secretary, if such corporation makes such distribution after the 15th day of the 9th months after the close of the taxable year, an amount determined by multiplying (i) the amount equal to 41/2 percent of such distribution, by (ii) the number of its taxable years which begin after the taxable year with respect to which such distribution is made and before such distribution is made. For purposes of this title, any payment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be treated as interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain distributions made within 81/2 months after close of taxable year deemed for reasonable cause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A distribution made on or before the 15th day of the 9th month after the close of the taxable year shall be deemed for reasonable cause for purposes of paragraph (2)(A) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at least 70 percent of the gross receipts of such corporation for such taxable year consist of qualified export receipts, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the adjusted basis of the qualified export assets held by the corporation on the last day of each month of the taxable year equals or exceeds 70 percent of the sum of the adjusted basis of all assets held by the corporation on such day.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Ineligible corporations</h4>

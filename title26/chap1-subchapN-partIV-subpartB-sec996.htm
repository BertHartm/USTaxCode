<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rules for actual distributions and certain deemed distributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any actual distribution (other than a distribution described in paragraph (2) or to which section 995(c) applies) to a shareholder by a DISC (or former DISC) which is made out of earnings and profits shall be treated as made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first, out of previously taxed income, to the extent thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, out of accumulated DISC income, to the extent thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) finally, out of other earnings and profits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualifying distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any actual distribution made pursuant to section 992(c) (relating to distributions to meet qualification requirements), and any deemed distribution pursuant to section 995(b)(1)(G) (relating to foreign investment attributable to producer's loans), shall be treated as made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first, out of accumulated DISC income, to the extent thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, out of the earnings and profits described in paragraph (1)(C), to the extent thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) finally, out of previously taxed income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of any amount of any actual distribution to a C corporation made pursuant to section 992(c) which is required to satisfy the condition of section 992(a)(1)(A), the preceding sentence shall apply to 16/17ths of such amount and paragraph (1) shall apply to the remaining 1/17th of such amount.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exclusion from gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts distributed out of previously taxed income shall be excluded by the distributee from gross income except for gains described in subsection (e)(2), and shall reduce the amount of the previously taxed income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ordering rules for losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If for any taxable year a DISC, or a former DISC, incurs a deficit in earnings and profits, such deficit shall be chargeable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) first, to earnings and profits described in subsection (a)(1)(C), to the extent thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) second, to accumulated DISC income, to the extent thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) finally, to previously taxed income, except that a deficit in earnings and profits shall not be applied against accumulated DISC income which has been determined is to be deemed distributed to the shareholders (pursuant to section 995(b)(2)(A)) as a result of a revocation of election or other disqualification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priority of distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any actual distribution made during a taxable year shall be treated as being made subsequent to any deemed distribution made during such year. Any actual distribution made pursuant to section 992(c) (relating to distributions to meet qualification requirements) shall be treated as being made before any other actual distributions during the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Subsequent effect of previous disposition of DISC stock</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Shareholder previously taxed income adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) gain with respect to a share of stock of a DISC or former DISC is treated under section 995(c) as a dividend or as ordinary income, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any person subsequently receives an actual distribution made out of accumulated DISC income, or a deemed distribution made pursuant to section 995(b)(2), with respect to such share,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such person shall treat such distribution in the same manner as a distribution from previously taxed income to the extent that (i) the gain referred to in subparagraph (A), exceeds (ii) any other amounts with respect to such share which were treated under this paragraph as made from previously taxed income. In applying this paragraph with respect to a share of stock in a DISC or former DISC, gain on the acquisition of such share by the DISC or former DISC or gain on a transaction prior to such acquisition shall not be considered gain referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Corporate adjustment upon redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If section 995(c) applies to a redemption of stock in a DISC or former DISC, the accumulated DISC income shall be reduced by an amount equal to the gain described in section 995(c) with respect to such stock which is (or has been) treated as ordinary income, except to the extent distributions with respect to such stock have been treated under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Adjustment to basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Additions to basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts representing deemed distributions as provided in section 995(b) shall increase the basis of the stock with respect to which the distribution is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reductions of basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The portion of an actual distribution made out of previously taxed income shall reduce the basis of the stock with respect to which it is made, and to the extent that it exceeds the adjusted basis of such stock, shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property. In the case of stock includible in the gross estate of a decedent for which an election is made under section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation), this paragraph shall not apply to any distribution made after the date of the decedent's death and before the alternate valuation date provided by section 2032.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1540 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definition of divisions of earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) DISC income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The earnings and profits derived by a corporation during a taxable year in which such corporation is a DISC, before reduction for any distributions during the year, but reduced by amounts deemed distributed under section 995(b)(1), shall constitute the DISC income for such year. The earnings and profits of a DISC for a taxable year include any amounts includible in such DISC's gross income pursuant to section 951(a) for such year. Accumulated DISC income shall be reduced by deemed distributions under section 995(b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Previously taxed income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Earnings and profits deemed distributed under section 995(b) for a taxable year shall constitute previously taxed income for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Other earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The earnings and profits for a taxable year which are described in neither paragraph (1) nor (2) shall constitute the other earnings and profits for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effectively connected income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a shareholder who is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, trust, or estate, gains referred to in section 995(c) and all distributions out of accumulated DISC income including deemed distributions shall be treated as gains and distributions which are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business conducted through a permanent establishment of such shareholder within the United States and which are derived from sources within the United States.</p>

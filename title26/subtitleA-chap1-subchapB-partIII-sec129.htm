<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) employees not included in a dependent care assistance program who are included in a unit of employees covered by an agreement which the Secretary finds to be a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and 1 or more employees, if there is evidence that dependent care benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee representatives and such employer or employers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions and special rules</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A dependent care assistance program shall not be held or considered to fail to meet any requirements of subsection (d) (other than paragraphs (4) and (8) thereof) merely because of utilization rates for the different types of assistance made available under the program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Disallowance of excluded amounts as credit or deduction</h4>

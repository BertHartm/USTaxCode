<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer fails to substantially comply with any formal document request arising out of the examination of the tax treatment of any item (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;examined item&rdquo;) before the 90th day after the date of the mailing of such request on motion by the Secretary, any court having jurisdiction of a civil proceeding in which the tax treatment of the examined item is an issue shall prohibit the introduction by the taxpayer of any foreign-based documentation covered by such request.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Formal document request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;formal document request&rdquo; means any request (made after the normal request procedures have failed to produce the requested documentation) for the production of foreign-based documentation which is mailed by registered or certified mail to the taxpayer at his last known address and which sets forth&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the consequences to the taxpayer of the failure to produce the documentation described in subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Proceeding to quash</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, any person to whom a formal document request is mailed shall have the right to begin a proceeding to quash such request not later than the 90th day after the day such request was mailed. In any such proceeding, the Secretary may seek to compel compliance with such request.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The United States district court for the district in which the person (to whom the formal document request is mailed) resides or is found shall have jurisdiction to hear any proceeding brought under subparagraph (A). An order denying the petition shall be deemed a final order which may be appealed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Suspension of 90-day period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The running of the 90-day period referred to in subsection (a) shall be suspended during any period during which a proceeding brought under subparagraph (A) is pending.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Foreign-based documentation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;documentation&rdquo; includes books and records.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Authority to extend 90-day period</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If any person takes any action as provided in subsection (c)(2), the running of any period of limitations under section 6501 (relating to the assessment and collection of tax) or under section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions) with respect to such person shall be suspended for the period during which the proceeding under such subsection, and appeals therein, are pending.</p>

For purposes of the preceding sentence, all corporations which are members of the same controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a)) shall be treated as 1 corporation.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Pass-thru entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of paragraph (1), if a family corporation holds directly or indirectly any interest in a partnership, estate, trust or other pass-thru entity, such corporation shall take into account its proportionate share of the gross receipts of such entity.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Applicable percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;applicable percentage&rdquo; means the percentage equal to a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the numerator of which is the fair market value of the stock of another corporation held directly or indirectly as of the close of the taxable year by the family corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the denominator of which is the fair market value of all stock of such corporation as of such time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;stock&rdquo; does not include stock described in section 1563(c)(1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a partnership or trust shall be treated as owned proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if 50 percent or more in value of the stock in a corporation (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as &ldquo;first corporation&rdquo;) is owned, directly or through paragraph (2), by or for members of the same family, such members shall be considered as owning each class of stock in a second corporation (or a wholly owned subsidiary of such second corporation) owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the first corporation, in that proportion which the value of the stock in the first corporation which such members so own bears to the value of all the stock in the first corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraph (1), individuals related by the half blood or by legal adoption shall be treated as if they were related by the whole blood.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the transferee corporation or qualified partnership shall be deemed to have computed its taxable income on an annual accrual method of accounting during the period for which the transferor corporation or partnership computed its taxable income from such trade or business on an annual accrual method.</p>

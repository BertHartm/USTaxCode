<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a former spouse, but only if the transfer is incident to the divorce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any transfer of property described in subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for purposes of this subtitle, the property shall be treated as acquired by the transferee by gift, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the basis of the transferee in the property shall be the adjusted basis of the transferor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Incident to divorce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a)(2), a transfer of property is incident to the divorce if such transfer&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is related to the cessation of the marriage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rule where spouse is nonresident alien</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transfers in trust where liability exceeds basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to the transfer of property in trust to the extent that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the sum of the amount of the liabilities assumed, plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred.</p>

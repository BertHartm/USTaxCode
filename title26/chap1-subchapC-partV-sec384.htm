<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the assets of a corporation are acquired by another corporation in a reorganization described in subparagraph (A), (C), or (D) of section 368(a)(1), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) either of such corporations is a gain corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">income for any recognition period taxable year (to the extent attributable to recognized built-in gains) shall not be offset by any preacquisition loss (other than a preacquisition loss of the gain corporation).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exception where corporations under common control</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall not apply to the preacquisition loss of any corporation if such corporation and the gain corporation were members of the same controlled group at all times during the 5-year period ending on the acquisition date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Controlled group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; means a controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 1563(a)); except that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of certain income items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any item of income which is properly taken into account for any recognition period taxable year but which is attributable to periods before the acquisition date shall be treated as a recognized built-in gain for the taxable year in which it is properly taken into account and shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the net unrealized built-in gain.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Except as provided in regulations, the net operating loss shall, for purposes of clause (ii), be allocated ratably to each day in the year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of recognized built-in loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a corporation with a net unrealized built-in loss, the term &ldquo;preacquisition loss&rdquo; includes any recognized built-in loss.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation also to apply to excess credits or net capital losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Rules similar to the rules of subsection (a) shall also apply in the case of any excess credit (as defined in section 383(a)(2)) or net capital loss.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Ordering rules for net operating losses, etc.</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Carryover rules</h4>

A similar rule shall apply in the case of any excess credit or net capital loss limited by reason of subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Ordering rule for losses carried from same taxable year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a preacquisition loss for any taxable year is subject to limitation under subsection (a), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a net operating loss from such taxable year is not subject to such limitation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">taxable income shall be treated as having been offset 1st by the loss subject to such limitation.</p>

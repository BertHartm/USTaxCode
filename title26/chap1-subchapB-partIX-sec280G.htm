<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such payment is contingent on a change&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) in the ownership or effective control of the corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the aggregate present value of the payments in the nature of compensation to (or for the benefit of) such individual which are contingent on such change equals or exceeds an amount equal to 3 times the base amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of clause (ii), payments not treated as parachute payments under paragraph (4)(A), (5), or (6) shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;parachute payment&rdquo; shall also include any payment in the nature of compensation to (or for the benefit of) a disqualified individual if such payment is made pursuant to an agreement which violates any generally enforced securities laws or regulations. In any proceeding involving the issue of whether any payment made to a disqualified individual is a parachute payment on account of a violation of any generally enforced securities laws or regulations, the burden of proof with respect to establishing the occurrence of a violation of such a law or regulation shall be upon the Secretary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:614 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Treatment of certain agreements entered into within 1 year before change of ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), any payment pursuant to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an amendment made within such 1-year period of a previous agreement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall be presumed to be contingent on such change unless the contrary is established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;base amount&rdquo; means the individual's annualized includible compensation for the base period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The portion of the base amount allocated to any parachute payment shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the base amount as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the present value of such payment, bears to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the aggregate present value of all such payments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of amounts which taxpayer establishes as reasonable compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any payment described in paragraph (2)(A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount treated as a parachute payment shall not include the portion of such payment which the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the date of the change described in paragraph (2)(A)(i), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount treated as an excess parachute payment shall be reduced by the portion of such payment which the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before the date of the change described in paragraph (2)(A)(i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (B), reasonable compensation for services actually rendered before the date of the change described in paragraph (2)(A)(i) shall be first offset against the base amount.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Annualized includible compensation for base period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;annualized includible compensation for the base period&rdquo; means the average annual compensation which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was payable by the corporation with respect to which the change in ownership or control described in paragraph (2)(A) of subsection (b) occurs, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) was includible in the gross income of the disqualified individual for taxable years in the base period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in regulations, all members of the same affiliated group (as defined in section 1504, determined without regard to section 1504(b)) shall be treated as 1 corporation for purposes of this section. Any person who is an officer of any member of such group shall be treated as an officer of such 1 corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section (including regulations for the application of this section in the case of related corporations and in the case of personal service corporations).</p>

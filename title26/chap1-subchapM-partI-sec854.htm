<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such investment company meets the requirements of section 852(a) for the taxable year during which it paid such dividend,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then, in computing any deduction under section 243, there shall be taken into account only that portion of such dividend designated under this subparagraph by the regulated investment company and such dividend shall be treated as received from a corporation which is not a 20-percent owned corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The aggregate amount which may be designated as dividends under subparagraph (A) shall not exceed the aggregate dividends received by the company for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice to shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of any distribution by a regulated investment company which may be taken into account as a dividend for purposes of the deduction under section 243 shall not exceed the amount so designated by the company in a written notice to its shareholders mailed not later than 60 days after the close of its taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Aggregate dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitations on dividends from regulated investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the amount of any dividend for purposes of this paragraph, a dividend received from a regulated investment company shall be subject to the limitations prescribed in this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for computing deduction under section 243</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), an amount shall be treated as a dividend for the purpose of paragraph (1) only if a deduction would have been allowable under section 243 to the regulated investment company determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) as if section 243 applied to dividends received by a regulated investment company,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) after the application of section 246 (but without regard to subsection (b) thereof), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) First, as amounts of income (other than gains, and amounts treated as gains, from the sale or other disposition of capital assets) includible in gross income to the extent of such income of the trust for the year and such undistributed income of the trust for prior years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Second, as a capital gain to the extent of the capital gain of the trust for the year and the undistributed capital gain of the trust for prior years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Third, as other income to the extent of such income of the trust for the year and such undistributed income of the trust for prior years; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemption from income taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A charitable remainder annuity trust and a charitable remainder unitrust shall, for any taxable year, not be subject to any tax imposed by this subtitle, unless such trust, for such year, has unrelated business taxable income (within the meaning of section 512, determined as if part III of subchapter F applied to such trust).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Charitable remainder annuity trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a charitable remainder annuity trust is a trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) from which a sum certain (which is not less than 5 percent of the initial net fair market value of all property placed in trust) is to be paid, not less often than annually, to one or more persons (at least one of which is not an organization described in section 170(c) and, in the case of individuals, only to an individual who is living at the time of the creation of the trust) for a term of years (not in excess of 20 years) or for the life or lives of such individual or individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) from which no amount other than the payments described in subparagraph (A) may be paid to or for the use of any person other than an organization described in section 170(c), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) following the termination of the payments described in subparagraph (A), the remainder interest in the trust is to be transferred to, or for the use of, an organization described in section 170(c) or is to be retained by the trust for such a use.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charitable remainder unitrust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a charitable remainder unitrust is a trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) from which a fixed percentage (which is not less than 5 percent) of the net fair market value of its assets, valued annually, is to be paid, not less often than annually, to one or more persons (at least one of which is not an organization described in section 170(c) and, in the case of individuals, only to an individual who is living at the time of the creation of the trust) for a term of years (not in excess of 20 years) or for the life or lives of such individual or individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) from which no amount other than the payments described in subparagraph (A) may be paid to or for the use of any person other than an organization described in section 170(c), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) following the termination of the payments described in subparagraph (A), the remainder interest in the trust is to be transferred to, or for the use of, an organization described in section 170(c) or is to be retained by the trust for such a use.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (2)(A) and (B), the trust instrument may provide that the trustee shall pay the income beneficiary for any year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the trust income, if such amount is less than the amount required to be distributed under paragraph (2)(A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount of the trust income which is in excess of the amount required to be distributed under paragraph (2)(A), to the extent that (by reason of subparagraph (A)) the aggregate of the amounts paid in prior years <!-- PDFPage:1138 -->was less than the aggregate of such required amounts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Valuation for purposes of charitable contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the amount of any charitable contribution, the remainder interest of a charitable remainder annuity trust or charitable remainder unitrust shall be computed on the basis that an amount equal to 5 percent of the net fair market value of its assets (or a greater amount, if required under the terms of the trust instrument) is to be distributed each year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certain contingencies permitted</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a trust would, but for a qualified contingency, meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(A) or (2)(A) of subsection (d), such trust shall be treated as meeting such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Value determined without regard to qualified contingency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining the amount of any charitable contribution (or the actuarial value of any interest), a qualified contingency shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualified contingency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified contingency&rdquo; means any provision of a trust which provides that, upon the happening of a contingency, the payments described in paragraph (1)(A) or (2)(A) of subsection (d) (as the case may be) will terminate not later than such payments would otherwise terminate under the trust.</p>

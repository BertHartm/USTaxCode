<p class="note-body">1986&mdash;Subsec. (b)(2). Pub. L. 99&ndash;514, &sect;1108(g)(2), amended par.

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 99&ndash;514, &sect;1875(c)(4), struck out &ldquo;reduced by any amount allowable as a deduction to the individual in computing adjusted gross income under paragraph (7) of section 62&rdquo; after &ldquo;(as defined in section 401(c)(2))&rdquo;.</p>

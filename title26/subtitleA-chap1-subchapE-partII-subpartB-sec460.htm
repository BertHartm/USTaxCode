<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement that percentage of completion method be used</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any long-term contract, the taxable income from such contract shall be determined under the percentage of completion method (as modified by subsection (b)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Percentage of completion method</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirements of percentage of completion method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), in the case of any long-term contract with respect to which the percentage of completion method is used&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage of completion shall be determined by comparing costs allocated to the contract under subsection (c) and incurred before the close of the taxable year with the estimated total contract costs, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) upon completion of the contract (or, with respect to any amount properly taken into account after completion of the contract, when such amount is so properly taken into account), the taxpayer shall pay (or shall be entitled to receive) interest computed under the look-back method of paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of any long-term contract with respect to which the percentage of completion method is used, except for purposes of applying the look-back method of paragraph (2), any income under the contract (to the extent not previously includible in gross income) shall be included in gross income for the taxable year following the taxable year in which the contract was completed. For purposes of subtitle F (other than sections 6654 and 6655), any interest required to be paid by the taxpayer under subparagraph (B) shall be treated as an increase in the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the contract is completed (or, in the case of interest payable with respect to any amount properly taken into account after completion of the contract, for the taxable year in which the amount is so properly taken into account).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Look-back method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The interest computed under the look-back method of this paragraph shall be determined by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first&nbsp;<sup><a href="#460_1_target" name="460_1">1</a></sup> allocating income under the contract among taxable years before the year in which the contract is completed on the basis of the actual contract price and costs instead of the estimated contract price and costs,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, determining (solely for purposes of computing such interest) the overpayment or underpayment of tax for each taxable year referred to in subparagraph (A) which would result solely from the application of subparagraph (A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) then using the adjusted overpayment rate (as defined in paragraph (7)), compounded daily, on the overpayment or underpayment determined under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, any amount properly taken into account after completion of the contract shall be taken into account by discounting (using the Federal mid-term rate determined under section 1274(d) as of the time such amount was properly taken into account) such amount to its value as of the completion of the contract. The taxpayer may elect with respect to any contract to have the preceding sentence not apply to such contract.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Simplified method of cost allocation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) 1 percent of the average annual gross receipts of the taxpayer for the 3 taxable years preceding the taxable year in which the contract was completed, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) which is completed within 2 years of the contract commencement date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in determining overpayments and underpayments for purposes of applying paragraph (2)(B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) any increase in the income under the contract for any taxable year by reason of the allocation under paragraph (2)(A) shall be treated as giving rise to an underpayment determined by applying the highest rate for such year to such increase, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any decrease in such income for any taxable year by reason of such allocation shall be treated as giving rise to an overpayment determined by applying the highest rate for such year to such decrease, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any interest required to be paid by the taxpayer under paragraph (2) shall be paid by such entity (and any interest entitled to be received by the taxpayer under paragraph (2) shall be paid to such entity).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply in connection with any group health plan in any case in which the decision to discharge the mother or her newborn child prior to the expiration of the minimum length of stay otherwise required under paragraph (1)(A) is made by an attending provider in consultation with the mother.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prohibitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A group health plan may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) deny to the mother or her newborn child eligibility, or continued eligibility, to enroll or to renew coverage under the terms of the plan, solely for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide monetary payments or rebates to mothers to encourage such mothers to accept less than the minimum protections available under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) penalize or otherwise reduce or limit the reimbursement of an attending provider because such provider provided care to an individual participant or beneficiary in accordance with this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide incentives (monetary or otherwise) to an attending provider to induce such provider to provide care to an individual participant or beneficiary in a manner inconsistent with this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to subsection (c)(3), restrict benefits for any portion of a period within a hospital length of stay required under subsection (a) in a manner which is less favorable than the benefits provided for any preceding portion of such stay.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a mother who is a participant or beneficiary&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to stay in the hospital for a fixed period of time following the birth of her child.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section shall not apply with respect to any group health plan which does not provide benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth for a mother or her newborn child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a group health plan from imposing deductibles, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing in relation to benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth for a mother or newborn child under the plan, except that such coinsurance or other cost-sharing for any portion of a period within a hospital length of stay required under subsection (a) may not be greater than such coinsurance or cost-sharing for any preceding portion of such stay.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Level and type of reimbursements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a group health plan from negotiating the level and type of reimbursement with a provider for care provided in accordance with this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Such State law requires such coverage to provide for at least a 48-hour hospital length of stay following a normal vaginal delivery and at least a 96-hour hospital length of stay following a caesarean section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Such State law requires, in connection with such coverage for maternity care, that the hospital length of stay for such care is left to the decision of (or required to be made by) the attending provider in consultation with the mother.</p>

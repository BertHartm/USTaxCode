<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recognition upon sale or disposition in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to any gain recognized under this chapter, there shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of any stock for the taxable year in which the sale or disposition of such stock occurs an amount equal to the aggregate nontaxed portions of any extraordinary dividends with respect to such stock which did not reduce the basis of such stock by reason of the limitation on reducing basis below zero.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining a taxpayer's adjusted basis for purposes of subsection (c)(1), any reduction in basis under subsection (a)(1) by reason of a prior distribution which was an extraordinary dividend shall be treated as occurring at the beginning of the ex-dividend date for such distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distributions in kind</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of holding period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining the holding period of stock under subsection (a)(2), rules similar to the rules of paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 246(c) shall apply; except that &ldquo;2 years&rdquo; shall be substituted for the number of days specified in subparagraph (B) of section 246(c)(3).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not pro rata as to all shareholders,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">any amount treated as a dividend under section 301 with respect to such redemption shall be treated as an extraordinary dividend to which paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) apply without regard to the period the taxpayer held such stock.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the taxpayer disposes of such stock before it has been held for more than 5 years, the aggregate reduction under subsection (a)(1) with respect to such dividends shall not be greater than the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the qualified preferred dividends paid with respect to such stock during the period the taxpayer held such stock, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the qualified preferred dividends which would have been paid during such period on the basis of the stated rate of return.</p>

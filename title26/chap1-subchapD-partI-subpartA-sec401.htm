<p class="statutory-body">A trust created or organized in the United States and forming part of a stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing plan of an employer for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries shall constitute a qualified trust under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if contributions are made to the trust by such employer, or employees, or both, or by another employer who is entitled to deduct his contributions under section 404(a)(3)(B) (relating to deduction for contributions to profit-sharing and stock bonus plans), for the purpose of distributing to such employees or their beneficiaries the corpus and income of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if under the trust instrument it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees and their beneficiaries under the trust, for any part of the corpus or income to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries (but this paragraph shall not be construed, in the case of a multiemployer plan, to prohibit the return of a contribution within 6 months after the plan administrator determines that the contribution was made by a mistake of fact or law (other than a mistake relating to whether the plan is described in section 401(a) or the trust which is part of such plan is exempt from taxation under section 501(a), or the return of any withdrawal liability payment determined to be an overpayment within 6 months of such determination).;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#401_1_target" name="401_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Contributions and benefits may bear uniform relationship to compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or benefits of, or on behalf of, the employees under the plan bear a uniform relationship to the compensation (within the meaning of section 414(s)) of such employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Certain disparity permitted</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or benefits of, or on behalf of, the employees under the plan favor highly compensated employees (as defined in section 414(q)) in the manner permitted under subsection (l).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A defined benefit plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the plan provides that the employer-derived accrued retirement benefit for any participant under the plan may not exceed the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the participant's final pay with the employer, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the employer-derived retirement benefit created under Federal law attributable to service by the participant with the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;For purposes of this clause, the employer-derived retirement benefit created under Federal law shall be treated as accruing ratably over 35 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Final pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, the participant's final pay is the compensation (as defined in section 414(q)(7)) paid to the participant by the employer for any year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) which ends during the 5-year period ending with the year in which the participant separated from service for the employer, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the employees&rsquo; rights to benefits under the separate plans do not become nonforfeitable at the same rate, but the levels of benefits provided by the separate plans satisfy the requirements of regulations prescribed by the Secretary to take account of the differences in such rates, the plans shall not be considered discriminatory merely because of the difference in such rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 5-<cap-smallcap>year rule for other cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that, if an employee dies before the distribution of the employee's interest has begun in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), the entire interest of the employee will be distributed within 5 years after the death of such employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Exception to 5-year rule for certain amounts payable over life of beneficiary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) any portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated beneficiary,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such portion will be distributed (in accordance with regulations) over the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) such distributions begin not later than 1 year after the date of the employee's death or such later date as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe,</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of a plan which provides for the payment of an early retirement benefit, a trust forming a part of such plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless a participant who satisfied the service requirements for such early retirement benefit, but separated from the service (with any nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit) before satisfying the age requirement for such early retirement benefit, is entitled upon satisfaction of such age requirement to receive a benefit not less than the benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age, actuarially, reduced under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

The preceding sentence shall not apply to the accrued benefit of any participant unless, at the time of such withdrawal, such participant has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of such accrued benefit (as determined under section 411). The first sentence of this paragraph shall not apply to the extent that an accrued benefit is permitted to be forfeited in accordance with section 411(a)(3)(D)(iii) (relating to proportional forfeitures of benefits accrued before September 2, 1974, in the event of withdrawal of certain mandatory contributions).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">then the gross income of the taxpayer for such taxable year shall be adjusted as provided in subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustment for replacements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the liquidated goods are replaced (in whole or in part) during any replacement year and such replacement is reflected in the closing inventory for such year, then the gross income for the liquidation year shall be&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) increased by an amount equal to the excess of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Solely for purposes of determining interest on any overpayment or underpayment attributable to an adjustment made under this section, such overpayment or underpayment shall <!-- PDFPage:1087 -->be treated as an overpayment or underpayment (as the case may be) for the replacement year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Coordination with section 472</h4>

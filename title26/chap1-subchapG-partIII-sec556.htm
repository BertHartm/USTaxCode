<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of subsection (a), the taxable income shall be adjusted as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be allowed as a deduction Federal income and excess profits taxes and income, war profits, and excess-profits taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States (to the extent not allowable as a deduction under section 275(a)(4)), accrued during the taxable year, but not including the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541, or the taxes imposed by corresponding sections of a prior income tax law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charitable contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The deduction for charitable contributions provided under section 170 shall be allowed, but in computing such deduction the limitations in section 170(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D) shall apply, and section 170(b)(2) and (d)(1) shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;contribution base&rdquo; when used in section 170(b)(1) means the taxable income computed with the adjustments (other than the 10-percent limitation) provided in section 170(b)(2) and (d)(1) and without the deduction of the amounts disallowed under paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection or the inclusion in gross income of the amounts includible therein as dividends by reason of the application of the provisions of section 555(b) (relating to the inclusion in gross income of a foreign personal holding company of its distributive share of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of another company in which it is a shareholder).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special deductions disallowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The special deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received by corporations, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Net operating loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed, but there shall be allowed as a deduction the amount of the net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for the preceding taxable year computed without the deductions provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Expenses and depreciation applicable to property of the taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The aggregate of the deductions allowed under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) and section 167 (relating to depreciation) which are allocable to the operation and maintenance of property owned or operated by the company, shall be allowed only in an amount equal to the rent or other compensation received for the use of, or the right to use, the property, unless it is established (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the satisfaction of the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that the rent or other compensation received was the highest obtainable, or, if none was received, that none was obtainable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that the property was held in the course of a business carried on bona fide for profit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) either that there was reasonable expectation that the operation of the property would result in a profit, or that the property was necessary to the conduct of the business.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Taxes and contributions to pension trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The deductions provided in section 164(e) (relating to taxes of a shareholder paid by the corporation) and in section 404 (relating to pension, etc., trusts) shall not be allowed.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement of withholding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, every employer making payment of wages shall deduct and withhold upon such wages a tax determined in accordance with tables or computational procedures prescribed by the Secretary. Any tables or procedures prescribed under this paragraph shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) apply with respect to the amount of wages paid during such periods as the Secretary may prescribe, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be in such form, and provide for such amounts to be deducted and withheld, as the Secretary determines to be most appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter and to reflect the provisions of chapter 1 applicable to such periods.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of applying tables or procedures prescribed under paragraph (1), the term <!-- PDFPage:2031 -->&ldquo;the amount of wages&rdquo; means the amount by which the wages exceed the number of withholding exemptions claimed multiplied by the amount of one such exemption. The amount of each withholding exemption shall be equal to the amount of one personal exemption provided in section 151(b), prorated to the payroll period. The maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted shall be calculated in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary under this section, taking into account any reduction in withholding to which an employee is entitled under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Percentage method of withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If wages are paid with respect to a period which is not a payroll period, the withholding exemption allowable with respect to each payment of such wages shall be the exemption allowed for a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days (including Sundays and holidays) equal to the number of days in the period with respect to which such wages are paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which wages are paid by an employer without regard to any payroll period or other period, the withholding exemption allowable with respect to each payment of such wages shall be the exemption allowed for a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days equal to the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) which have elapsed since the date of the last payment of such wages by such employer during the calendar year, or the date of commencement of employment with such employer during such year, or January 1 of such year, whichever is the later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which the period, or the time described in paragraph (2), in respect of any wages is less than one week, the Secretary, under regulations prescribed by him, may authorize an employer to compute the tax to be deducted and withheld as if the aggregate of the wages paid to the employee during the calendar week were paid for a weekly payroll period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under this subsection, the wages may, at the election of the employer, be computed to the nearest dollar.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Wage bracket withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At the election of the employer with respect to any employee, the employer shall deduct and withhold upon the wages paid to such employee a tax (in lieu of the tax required to be deducted and withheld under subsection (a)) determined in accordance with tables prescribed by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If wages are paid with respect to a period which is not a payroll period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days (including Sundays and holidays) equal to the number of days in the period with respect to which such wages are paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which wages are paid by an employer without regard to any payroll period or other period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days equal to the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) which have elapsed since the date of the last payment of such wages by such employer during the calendar year, or the date of commencement of employment with such employer during such year, or January 1 of such year, whichever is the later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In any case in which the period, or the time described in paragraph (3), in respect of any wages is less than one week, the Secretary, under regulations prescribed by him, may authorize an employer to determine the amount to be deducted and withheld under the tables applicable in the case of a weekly payroll period, in which case the aggregate of the wages paid to the employee during the calendar week shall be considered the weekly wages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the wages exceed the highest wage bracket, in determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under this subsection, the wages may, at the election of the employer, be computed to the nearest dollar.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In the case of wages paid after December 31, 1969, the amount deducted and withheld under paragraph (1) shall be determined in accordance with tables prescribed by the Secretary. In the tables so prescribed, the amounts set forth as amounts of wages and amounts of income tax to be deducted and withheld shall be computed on the basis of the table for an annual payroll period prescribed pursuant to subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tax paid by recipient</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the employer, in violation of the provisions of this chapter, fails to deduct and withhold the tax under this chapter, and thereafter the tax against which such tax may be credited is paid, the tax so required to be deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the employer; but this subsection shall in no case relieve the employer from liability for any penalties or additions to the tax otherwise applicable in respect of such failure to deduct and withhold.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Included and excluded wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for services performed during one-half or more of any payroll period of not more than 31 consecutive days constitutes wages, all the remuneration paid by such employer to such employee for such period shall be deemed to be wages; but if the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for services performed during more than one-half of any such payroll period does not constitute wages, then none of the remuneration paid by such employer to such employee for such period shall be deemed to be wages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Withholding exemptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An employee receiving wages shall on any day be entitled to the following withholding exemptions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an exemption for himself unless he is an individual described in section 151(d)(2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the employee is married, any exemption to which his spouse is entitled, or would be entitled if such spouse were an employee receiving wages, under subparagraph (A) or (D), but only if such spouse does not have in <!-- PDFPage:2032 -->effect a withholding exemption certificate claiming such exemption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an exemption for each individual with respect to whom, on the basis of facts existing at the beginning of such day, there may reasonably be expected to be allowable an exemption under section 151(c) for the taxable year under subtitle A in respect of which amounts deducted and withheld under this chapter in the calendar year in which such day falls are allowed as a credit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any allowance to which he is entitled under subsection (m), but only if his spouse does not have in effect a withholding exemption certificate claiming such allowance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) a standard deduction allowance which shall be an amount equal to one exemption (or more than one exemption if so prescribed by the Secretary) unless (i) he is married (as determined under section 7703) and his spouse is an employee receiving wages subject to withholding or (ii) he has withholding exemption certificates in effect with respect to more than one employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this title, any standard deduction allowance under subparagraph (E) shall be treated as if it were denominated a withholding exemption.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exemption certificates</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) On commencement of employment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On or before the date of the commencement of employment with an employer, the employee shall furnish the employer with a signed withholding exemption certificate relating to the number of withholding exemptions which he claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which he is entitled.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Change of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, on any day during the calendar year, the number of withholding exemptions to which the employee is entitled is less than the number of withholding exemptions claimed by the employee on the withholding exemption certificate then in effect with respect to him, the employee shall within 10 days thereafter furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate relating to the number of withholding exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which he is entitled on such day. If, on any day during the calendar year, the number of withholding exemptions to which the employee is entitled is greater than the number of withholding exemptions claimed, the employee may furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate relating to the number of withholding exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which he is entitled on such day.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Change of status which affects next calendar year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If on any day during the calendar year the number of withholding exemptions to which the employee will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, entitled at the beginning of his next taxable year under subtitle A is different from the number to which the employee is entitled on such day, the employee shall, in such cases and at such times as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe, furnish the employer with a withholding exemption certificate relating to the number of withholding exemptions which he claims with respect to such next taxable year, which shall in no event exceed the number to which he will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, so entitled.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) When certificate takes effect</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) First certificate furnished</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A withholding exemption certificate furnished the employer in cases in which no previous such certificate is in effect shall take effect as of the beginning of the first payroll period ending, or the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period, on or after the date on which such certificate is so furnished.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Furnished to take place of existing certificate</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a withholding exemption certificate furnished to the employer in cases in which a previous such certificate is in effect shall take effect as of the beginning of the 1st payroll period ending (or the 1st payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period) on or after the 30th day after the day on which such certificate is so furnished.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Employer may elect earlier effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">At the election of the employer, a certificate described in clause (i) may be made effective beginning with any payment of wages made on or after the day on which the certificate is so furnished and before the 30th day referred to in clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Change of status which affects next year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any certificate furnished pursuant to paragraph (2)(C) shall not take effect, and may not be made effective, with respect to any payment of wages made in the calendar year in which the certificate is furnished.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Period during which certificate remains in effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A withholding exemption certificate which takes effect under this subsection, or which on December 31, 1954, was in effect under the corresponding subsection of prior law, shall continue in effect with respect to the employer until another such certificate takes effect under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Form and contents of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Withholding exemption certificates shall be in such form and contain such information as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), a nonresident alien individual (other than an individual described in section 3401(a)(6)(A) or (B)) shall be entitled to only one withholding exemption.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Exemption where certificate with another employer is in effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a withholding exemption certificate is in effect with respect to one employer, an employee shall not be entitled under a certificate in effect with any other employer to any withholding exemption which he has claimed under such first certificate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Overlapping pay periods, and payment by agent or fiduciary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a payment of wages is made to an employee by an employer&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the manner of withholding and the amount to be deducted and withheld under this chapter shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary under which the withholding exemption allowed to the employee in any calendar year shall approximate the withholding exemption allowable with respect to an annual payroll period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Alternative methods of computing amount to be withheld</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, under regulations prescribed by him, authorize&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Withholding on basis of average wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An employer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to estimate the wages which will be paid to any employee in any quarter of the calendar year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to determine the amount to be deducted and withheld upon each payment of wages to such employee during such quarter as if the appropriate average of the wages so estimated constituted the actual wages paid, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to deduct and withhold upon any payment of wages to such employee during such quarter (and, in the case of tips referred to in subsection (k), within 30 days thereafter) such amount as may be necessary to adjust the amount actually deducted and withheld upon the wages of such employee during such quarter to the amount required to be deducted and withheld during such quarter without regard to this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withholding on basis of annualized wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An employer to determine the amount of tax to be deducted and withheld upon a payment of wages to an employee for a payroll period by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) multiplying the amount of an employee's wages for a payroll period by the number of such payroll periods in the calendar year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determining the amount of tax which would be required to be deducted and withheld upon the amount determined under subparagraph (A) if such amount constituted the actual wages for the calendar year and the payroll period of the employee were an annual payroll period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) dividing the amount of tax determined under subparagraph (B) by the number of payroll periods (described in subparagraph (A)) in the calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Withholding on basis of cumulative wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An employer, in the case of any employee who requests to have the amount of tax to be withheld from his wages computed on the basis of his cumulative wages, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) add the amount of the wages to be paid to the employee for the payroll period to the total amount of wages paid by the employer to the employee during the calendar year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) divide the aggregate amount of wages computed under subparagraph (A) by the number of payroll periods to which such aggregate amount of wages relates,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) compute the total amount of tax that would have been required to be deducted and withheld under subsection (a) if the average amount of wages (as computed under subparagraph (B)) had been paid to the employee for the number of payroll periods to which the aggregate amount of wages (computed under subparagraph (A)) relates,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) determine the excess, if any, of the amount of tax computed under subparagraph (C) over the total amount of tax deducted and withheld by the employer from wages paid to the employee during the calendar year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) deduct and withhold upon the payment of wages (referred to in subparagraph (A)) to the employee an amount equal to the excess (if any) computed under subparagraph (D).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Other methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An employer to determine the amount of tax to be deducted and withheld upon the wages paid to an employee by any other method which will require the employer to deduct and withhold upon such wages substantially the same amount as would be required to be deducted and withheld by applying subsection (a) or (c), either with respect to a payroll period or with respect to the entire taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Changes in withholding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of remuneration paid in any medium other than cash for services performed by an individual as a retail salesman for a person, where the service performed by such individual for such person is ordinarily performed for remuneration solely by way of cash commission an employer shall not be required to deduct or withhold any tax under this subchapter with respect to such remuneration, provided that such employer files with the Secretary such information with respect to such remuneration as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Tips</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of tips which constitute wages, subsection (a) shall be applicable only to such tips as are included in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a), and only to the extent that the tax can be deducted and withheld by the employer, at or after the time such statement is so furnished and before the close of the calendar year in which such statement is furnished, from such wages of the employee (excluding tips, but including funds turned over by the employee to the employer for the purpose of such deduction and withholding) as are under the control of the employer; and an employer who is furnished by an employee a written statement of tips (received in a calendar month) pursuant to section 6053(a) to which paragraph (16)(B) of section 3401(a) is applicable may deduct and withhold the tax with respect to such tips from any wages of the employee (excluding tips) under his control, even though at the time such statement is furnished the total amount of the tips included in statements furnished to the employer as having been received by the employee in such calendar month in the course of his employment by such employer is less than $20. Such tax shall not at any time be deducted and withheld in an amount which exceeds the aggregate of such wages and funds (including funds turned over under section 3102(c)(2) or section 3202(c)(2)) minus any tax required by section 3102(a) or section 3202(a) to be collected from such wages and funds.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disclosure of status by employee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An employee shall be entitled to furnish the employer with a withholding exemption certificate indicating he is married only if, on the day of such furnishing, he is married (determined with the application of the rules in paragraph (3)).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such additional deductions (including the additional standard deduction under section 63(c)(3) for the aged and blind) and other items as may be specified by the Secretary in regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Employees incurring no income tax liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an employer shall not be required to deduct and withhold any tax under this chapter upon a payment of wages to an employee if there is in effect with respect to such payment a withholding exemption certificate (in such form and containing such other information as the Secretary may prescribe) furnished to the employer by the employee certifying that the employee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) incurred no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A for his preceding taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) anticipates that he will incur no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A for his current taxable year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall by regulations provide for the coordination of the provisions of this subsection with the provisions of subsection (f).</p>

The amount deducted and withheld with respect to a payment which is greater or less than a full payment shall bear the same relation to the specified amount as such payment bears to a full payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Request for withholding</h4>

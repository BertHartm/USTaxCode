<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the transaction was not used principally as a device for the distribution of the <!-- PDFPage:736 -->earnings and profits of the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation or both (but the mere fact that subsequent to the distribution stock or securities in one or more of such corporations are sold or exchanged by all or some of the distributees (other than pursuant to an arrangement negotiated or agreed upon prior to such distribution) shall not be construed to mean that the transaction was used principally as such a device),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the requirements of subsection (b) (relating to active businesses) are satisfied, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) as part of the distribution, the distributing corporation distributes&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then no gain or loss shall be recognized to (and no amount shall be includible in the income of) such shareholder or security holder on the receipt of such stock or securities.</p>

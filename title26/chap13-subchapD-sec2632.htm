<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Time and manner of allocation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any allocation by an individual of his GST exemption under section 2631(a) may be made at any time on or before the date prescribed for filing the estate tax return for such individual's estate (determined with regard to extensions), regardless of whether such a return is required to be filed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Manner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe by forms or regulations the manner in which any allocation referred to in paragraph (1) is to be made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deemed allocation to certain lifetime direct skips</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any individual makes a direct skip during his lifetime, any unused portion of such individual's GST exemption shall be allocated to the property transferred to the extent necessary to make the inclusion ratio for such property zero. If the amount of the direct skip exceeds such unused portion, the entire unused portion shall be allocated to the property transferred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Unused portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the unused portion of an individual's GST exemption is that portion of such exemption which has not previously been allocated by such individual (or treated as allocated under paragraph (1) with respect to a prior direct skip).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1883 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsection not to apply in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual may elect to have this subsection not apply to a transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of unused GST exemption</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any portion of an individual's GST exemption which has not been allocated within the time prescribed by subsection (a) shall be deemed to be allocated as follows&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first, to property which is the subject of a direct skip occurring at such individual's death, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, to trusts with respect to which such individual is the transferor and from which a taxable distribution or a taxable termination might occur at or after such individual's death.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation within categories</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The allocation under paragraph (1) shall be made among the properties described in subparagraph (A) thereof and the trusts described in subparagraph (B) thereof, as the case may be, in proportion to the respective amounts (at the time of allocation) of the nonexempt portions of such properties or trusts.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nonexempt portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;nonexempt portion&rdquo; means the value (at the time of allocation) of the property or trust, multiplied by the inclusion ratio with respect to such property or trust.</p>

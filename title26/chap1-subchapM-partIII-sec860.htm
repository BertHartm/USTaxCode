<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect on dividends paid deduction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) For taxable year in which paid</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) if the determination contains a finding that any part of any deficiency attributable to an adjustment with respect to the taxable year is due to fraud with intent to evade tax or to willfull&nbsp;<sup><a href="#860_2_target" name="860_2">2</a></sup> failure to file an income tax return within the time prescribed by law or prescribed by the Secretary in pursuance of law.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allowance of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit and phaseout adjustment based on inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The $3 amount in subsection (a) and the $23.50 and $6 amounts in paragraph (1) shall each be adjusted by multiplying such amount by the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year in which the sale occurs. In the case of gas from a tight formation, the $3 amount in subsection (a) shall not be adjusted.</p>

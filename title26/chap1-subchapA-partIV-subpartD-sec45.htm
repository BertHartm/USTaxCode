<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations and adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Phaseout of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the credit determined under subsection (a) shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the credit (determined without regard to this paragraph) as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount by which the reference price for the calendar year in which the sale occurs exceeds 8 cents, bears to</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit and phaseout adjustment based on inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The 1.5 cent amount in subsection (a) and the 8 cent amount in paragraph (1) shall each be adjusted by multiplying such amount by the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year in which the sale occurs. If any amount as increased under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of 0.1 cent, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.1 cent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Credit reduced for grants, tax-exempt bonds, subsidized energy financing, and other credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the credit determined under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any taxable year (determined after the application of paragraphs (1) and (2)) shall be reduced by the amount which is the product of the amount so determined for such year and a fraction&mdash;</p>

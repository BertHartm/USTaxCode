<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Later payments treated as receipt of tax paid amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any amount is treated as received under paragraph (1) with respect to any installment obligation, subsequent payments received on such obligation shall not be taken into account for purposes of section 453 to the extent that the aggregate of such subsequent payments does not exceed the aggregate amount treated as received under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Secured indebtedness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection indebtedness is secured by an installment obligation to the extent that payment of principal or interest on such indebtedness is directly secured (under the terms of the indebtedness or any underlying arrangements) by any interest in such installment obligation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section, including regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) disallowing the use of the installment method in whole or in part for transactions in which the rules of this section otherwise would be avoided through the use of related persons, pass-thru entities, or intermediaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing that the sale of an interest in a partnership or other pass-thru entity will be treated as a sale of the proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or other entity.</p>

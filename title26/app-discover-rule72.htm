<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Scope:</strong> Any party may, without leave of Court, serve on any other party a request to:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Produce and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on such party's behalf, to inspect and copy any designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, phono-records, and other data compilations from which information can be obtained, translated, if necessary, by the responding party through detection devices into reasonably usable form), or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible thing, to the extent that any of the foregoing items are in the possession, custody, or control of the party on whom the request is served; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Permit entry upon designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspection and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated object or operation thereon.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedure:</strong> The request shall set forth the items to be inspected, either by individual item or category, and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity. It shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing the related acts. The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within 30 days after service of the request. The Court may allow a shorter or longer time. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to in whole or in part, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection is made to part of an item or category, then that part shall be specified. To obtain a ruling on an objection by the responding party, on a failure to respond, or on a failure to produce or permit inspection, the requesting party shall file an appropriate motion with the Court and shall annex thereto the request, with proof of service on the other party, together with the response and objections if any. Prior to moving for such a ruling, neither the request nor the response shall be filed with the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Foreign Petitioners:</strong> For production of records by foreign petitioners, see Code Section 7456(b).</p>

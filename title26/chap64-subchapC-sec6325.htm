<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Release of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary shall issue a certificate of release of any lien imposed with respect to any internal revenue tax not later than 30 days after the day on which&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Liability satisfied or unenforceable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary finds that the liability for the amount assessed, together with all interest in respect thereof, has been fully satisfied or has become legally unenforceable; or</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Bond accepted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is furnished to the Secretary and accepted by him a bond that is conditioned upon the payment of the amount assessed, together with all interest in respect thereof, within the time prescribed by law (including any extension of such time), and that is in accordance with such requirements relating to terms, conditions, and form of the bond and sureties thereon, as may be specified by such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Discharge of property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Property double the amount of the liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to any lien imposed under this chapter if the Secretary finds that the fair market value of that part of such property remaining subject to the lien is at least double the amount of the unsatisfied liability secured by such lien and the amount of all other liens upon such property which have priority over such lien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Part payment; interest of United States valueless</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there is paid over to the Secretary in partial satisfaction of the liability secured by the lien an amount determined by the Secretary, which shall not be less than the value, as determined by the Secretary, of the interest of the United States in the part to be so discharged, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines at any time that the interest of the United States in the part to be so discharged has no value.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In determining the value of the interest of the United States in the part to be so discharged, the Secretary shall give consideration to the value of such part and to such liens thereon as have priority over the lien of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Substitution of proceeds of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien if such part of the property is sold and, pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary, the proceeds of such sale are to be held, as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as such liens and claims had with respect to the discharged property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Estate or gift tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any or all of the property subject to any lien imposed by section 6324 if the Secretary finds that the liability secured by such lien has been fully satisfied or provided for.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Subordination of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of subordination of any lien imposed by this chapter upon any part of the property subject to such lien if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is paid over to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount of the lien or interest to which the certificate subordinates the lien of the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary believes that the amount realizable by the United States from the property to which the certificate relates, or from any other property subject to the lien, will ultimately be increased by reason of the issuance of such certificate and that the ultimate collection of the tax liability will be facilitated by such subordination, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of any lien imposed by section 6324B, if the Secretary determines that the United States will be adequately secured after such subordination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nonattachment of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that, because of confusion of names or otherwise, any person (other than the person against whom the tax was assessed) is or may be injured by the appearance that a notice of lien filed under section 6323 refers to such person, the Secretary may issue a certificate that the lien does not attach to the property of such person.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2480 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect of certificate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Conclusiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), if a certificate is issued pursuant to this section by the Secretary and is filed in the same office as the notice of lien to which it relates (if such notice of lien has been filed) such certificate shall have the following effect:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a certificate of release, such certificate shall be conclusive that the lien referred to in such certificate is extinguished;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a certificate of discharge, such certificate shall be conclusive that the property covered by such certificate is discharged from the lien;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a certificate of subordination, such certificate shall be conclusive that the lien or interest to which the lien of the United States is subordinated is superior to the lien of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a certificate of nonattachment, such certificate shall be conclusive that the lien of the United States does not attach to the property of the person referred to in such certificate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation of certificate of release or nonattachment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a certificate of release or nonattachment of a lien imposed by section 6321 was issued erroneously or improvidently, or if a certificate of release of such lien was issued pursuant to a collateral agreement entered into in connection with a compromise under section 7122 which has been breached, and if the period of limitation on collection after assessment has not expired, the Secretary may revoke such certificate and reinstate the lien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by mailing notice of such revocation to the person against whom the tax was assessed at his last known address, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by filing notice of such revocation in the same office in which the notice of lien to which it relates was filed (if such notice of lien had been filed).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such reinstated lien (i) shall be effective on the date notice of revocation is mailed to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A), but not earlier than the date on which any required filing of notice of revocation is filed in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (B), and (ii) shall have the same force and effect (as of such date), until the expiration of the period of limitation on collection after assessment, as a lien imposed by section 6321 (relating to lien for taxes).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certificates void under certain conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, any lien imposed by this chapter shall attach to any property with respect to which a certificate of discharge has been issued if the person liable for the tax reacquires such property after such certificate has been issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Filing of certificates and notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a certificate or notice issued pursuant to this section may not be filed in the office designated by State law in which the notice of lien imposed by section 6321 is filed, such certificate or notice shall be effective if filed in the office of the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which such office is situated.</p>

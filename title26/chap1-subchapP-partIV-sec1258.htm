<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which is recognized on the disposition or other termination of any position which was held as part of a conversion transaction,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">such gain (to the extent such gain does not exceed the applicable imputed income amount) shall be treated as ordinary income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applicable imputed income amount</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the taxpayer's net investment in the conversion transaction for the period ending on the date of such disposition or other termination (or, if earlier, the date on which the requirements of subsection (c) ceased to be <!-- PDFPage:1592 -->satisfied) at a rate equal to 120 percent of the applicable rate, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount treated as ordinary income under subsection (a) with respect to any prior disposition or other termination of a position which was held as a part of such transaction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall by regulations provide for such reductions in the applicable imputed income amount as may be appropriate by reason of amounts capitalized under section 263(g), ordinary income received, or otherwise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;built-in loss&rdquo; means the loss (if any) which would have been realized if the position had been disposed of or otherwise terminated at its fair market value as of the time such position became part of the conversion transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Position taken into account at fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the taxpayer's net investment in any conversion transaction, there shall be included the fair market value of any position which becomes part of such transaction (determined as of the time such position became part of such transaction).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the transaction (or the interest in the entity) was marketed or sold as producing capital gains treatment from a transaction described in subsection (c)(1), or</p>

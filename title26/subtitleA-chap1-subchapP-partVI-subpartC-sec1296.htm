<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If the fair market value of such stock as of the close of such taxable year exceeds its adjusted basis, such United States person shall include in gross income for such taxable year an amount equal to the amount of such excess.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the adjusted basis of such stock exceeds the fair market value of such stock as of the close of such taxable year, such United <!-- PDFPage:1769 -->States person shall be allowed a deduction for such taxable year equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of such excess, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The source of any amount included in gross income under subsection (a)(1) (or allowed as a deduction under subsection (a)(2)) shall be determined in the same manner as if such amount were gain or loss (as the case may be) from the sale of stock in the passive foreign investment company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unreversed inclusions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;unreversed inclusions&rdquo; means, with respect to any stock in a passive foreign investment company, the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>

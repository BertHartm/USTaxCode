<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of the tax imposed under section 2032A(c)(1) with respect to such disposition bears to the adjusted tax difference attributable to the entire interest (as determined under section 2032A(c)(2)(B)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this subsection shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe. Such an election, once made, shall be irrevocable.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Interest on recaptured amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an election is made under this subsection with respect to any additional estate tax imposed under section 2032A(c)(1), for purposes of section 6601 (relating to interest on underpayments), the last date prescribed for payment of such tax shall be deemed to be the last date prescribed for payment of the tax imposed by section 2001 with respect to the estate of the decedent (as determined for purposes of section 6601).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reduction in basis of automobile on which gas guzzler tax was imposed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 94 of Pub. L. 85&ndash;866, as amended by Pub. L. 99&ndash;514, &sect;2, Oct. 22, 1986, 100 Stat. 2095, provided that:</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Making of Election</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any taxpayer who held retirement-straight line property on his 1956 adjustment date may elect to have this section apply. Such an election shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe.

In the case of any such property retired during any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1929, the adjustment under this subparagraph shall not exceed that portion of the amount attributable to depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, which resulted (by reason of the deduction so allowed) in a reduction in taxes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or prior income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax laws.</p>

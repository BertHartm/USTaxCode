<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General:</strong> If a pleading to which a responsive pleading is permitted or required is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading, then the party may move for a more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading. The motion shall point out the defects complained of and the details desired. See Rules 70 and 90 for procedures available to narrow the issues or to elicit further information as to the facts involved or the positions of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Penalty for Failure of Response:</strong> The Court may strike the pleading to which the motion is directed or may make such other order as it deems just, if the required response is not made within such period as the Court may direct.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the distributable net income of the entire trust,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the items referred to in paragraph (2)(C) shall be excluded. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this subsection shall not affect the taxation of any distribution from the trust.</p>

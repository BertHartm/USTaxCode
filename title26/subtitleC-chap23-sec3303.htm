<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A taxpayer shall be allowed an additional credit under section 3302(b) with respect to any reduced rate of contributions permitted by a State law, only if the Secretary of Labor finds that under such law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no reduced rate of contributions to a pooled fund or to a partially pooled account is permitted to a person (or group of persons) having individuals in his (or their) employ except on the basis of his (or their) experience with respect to unemployment or other factors bearing a direct relation to unemployment risk during not less than the 3 consecutive years immediately preceding the computation date;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no reduced rate of contributions to a guaranteed employment account is permitted to a person (or a group of persons) having individuals in his (or their) employ unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the guaranty of remuneration was fulfilled in the year preceding the computation date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the balance of such account amounts to not less than 21/2 percent of that part of the payroll or payrolls for the 3 years preceding the computation date by which contributions to such account were measured; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such contributions were payable to such account with respect to 3 years preceding the computation date;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) no reduced rate of contributions to a reserve account is permitted to a person (or group of persons) having individuals in his (or their) employ unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) compensation has been payable from such account throughout the year preceding the computation date, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the balance of such account amounts to not less than five times the largest amount of compensation paid from such account within any 1 of the 3 years preceding such date, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the balance of such account amounts to not less than 21/2 percent of that part of the payroll or payrolls for the 3 years preceding such date by which contributions to such account were measured, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such contributions were payable to such account with respect to the 3 years preceding the computation date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For any person (or group of persons) who has (or have) not been subject to the State law for a period of time sufficient to compute the reduced rates permitted by paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection on a 3&ndash;year basis (i) the period of time required may be reduced to the amount of time the person (or group of persons) has (or have) had experience under or has (or have) been subject to the State law, whichever is appropriate, but in no case less than 1 year immediately preceding the computation date, or (ii) a reduced rate (not less than 1 percent) may be permitted by the State law on a reasonable basis other than as permitted by paragraph (1), (2), or (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification by the Secretary of Labor with respect to additional credit allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) On October 31 of each calendar year, the Secretary of Labor shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the law of each State (certified by the Secretary of Labor as provided in section 3304 for the 12-month period ending on such October 31), with respect to which he finds that re<!-- PDFPage:2061 -->duced rates of contributions were allowable with respect to such 12-month period only in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary of Labor finds that under the law of a single State (certified by the Secretary of Labor as provided in section 3304) more than one type of fund or account is maintained, and reduced rates of contributions to more than one type of fund or account were allowable with respect to any 12-month period ending on October 31, and one or more of such reduced rates were allowable under conditions not fulfilling the requirements of subsection (a), the Secretary of Labor shall, on such October 31, certify to the Secretary of the Treasury only those provisions of the State law pursuant to which reduced rates of contributions were allowable with respect to such 12-month period under conditions fulfilling the requirements of subsection (a), and shall, in connection therewith, designate the kind of fund or account, as defined in subsection (c), established by the provisions so certified. If the Secretary of Labor finds that a part of any reduced rate of contributions payable under such law or under such provisions is required to be paid into one fund or account and a part into another fund or account, the Secretary of Labor shall make such certification pursuant to this paragraph as he finds will assure the allowance of additional credits only with respect to that part of the reduced rate of contributions which is allowed under provisions which do fulfill the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Labor shall, within 30 days after any State law is submitted to him for such purpose, certify to the State agency his findings with respect to reduced rates of contributions to a type of fund or account, as defined in subsection (c), which are allowable under such State law only in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a). After making such findings, the Secretary of Labor shall not withhold his certification to the Secretary of the Treasury of such State law, or of the provisions thereof with respect to which such findings were made, for any 12-month period ending on October 31 pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) unless, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency, the Secretary of Labor finds the State law no longer contains the provisions specified in subsection (a) or the State has, with respect to such 12-month period, failed to comply substantially with any such provision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reserve account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;reserve account&rdquo; means a separate account in an unemployment fund, maintained with respect to a person (or group of persons) having individuals in his (or their) employ, from which account, unless such account is exhausted, is paid all and only compensation payable on the basis of services performed for such person (or for one or more of the persons comprising the group).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Pooled fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;pooled fund&rdquo; means an unemployment fund or any part thereof (other than a reserve account or a guaranteed employment account) into which the total contributions of persons contributing thereto are payable, in which all contributions are mingled and undivided, and from which compensation is payable to all individuals eligible for compensation from such fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Partially pooled account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;partially pooled account&rdquo; means a part of an unemployment fund in which part of the fund all contributions thereto are mingled and undivided, and from which part of the fund compensation is payable only to individuals to whom compensation would be payable from a reserve account or from a guaranteed employment account but for the exhaustion or termination of such reserve account or of such guaranteed employment account. Payments from a reserve account or guaranteed employment account into a partially pooled account shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (1) or (4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Guaranteed employment account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;guaranteed employment account&rdquo; means a separate account, in an unemployment fund, maintained with respect to a person (or group of persons) having individuals in his (or their) employ who, in accordance with the provisions of the State law or of a plan thereunder approved by the State agency,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) guarantees in advance at least 30 hours of work, for which remuneration will be paid at not less than stated rates, for each of 40 weeks (or if more, 1 weekly hour may be deducted for each added week guaranteed) in a year, to all the individuals who are in his (or their) employ in, and who continue to be available for suitable work in, one or more distinct establishments, except that any such individual's guaranty may commence after a probationary period (included within the 11 or less consecutive weeks immediately following the first week in which the individual renders services), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) gives security or assurance, satisfactory to the State agency, for the fulfillment of such guaranties, from which account, unless such account is exhausted or terminated, is paid all and only compensation, payable on the basis of services performed for such person (or for one or more of the persons comprising the group), to any such individual whose guaranteed remuneration has not been paid (either pursuant to the guaranty or from the security or assurance provided for the fulfillment of the guaranty), or whose guaranty is not renewed and who is otherwise eligible for compensation under the State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;year&rdquo; means any 12 consecutive calendar months.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;balance&rdquo;, with respect to a reserve account or a guaranteed employment account, means the amount standing to the credit of the account as of the computation date; except that, if subsequent to January 1, 1940, <!-- PDFPage:2062 -->any moneys have been paid into or credited to such account other than payments thereto by persons having individuals in their employ, such term shall mean the amount in such account as of the computation date less the total of such other moneys paid into or credited to such account subsequent to January 1, 1940.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Computation date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;computation date&rdquo; means the date, occurring at least once in each calendar year and within 27 weeks prior to the effective date of new rates of contributions, as of which such rates are computed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Reduced rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;reduced rate&rdquo; means a rate of contributions lower than the standard rate applicable under the State law, and the term &ldquo;standard rate&rdquo; means the rate on the basis of which variations therefrom are computed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Voluntary contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State law may, without being deemed to violate the standards set forth in subsection (a), permit voluntary contributions to be used in the computation of reduced rates if such contributions are paid prior to the expiration of 120 days after the beginning of the year for which such rates are effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payments by certain nonprofit organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State may, without being deemed to violate the standards set forth in subsection (a), permit an organization (or a group of organizations) described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) to elect (in lieu of paying contributions) to pay into the State unemployment fund amounts equal to the amounts of compensation attributable under the State law to service performed in the employ of such organization (or group).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To facilitate the orderly transition to coverage of service to which section 3309(a)(1)(A) applies, a State law may provide that an organization (or group of organizations) which elects before April 1, 1972, to make payments (in lieu of contributions) into the State unemployment fund as provided in section 3309(a)(2), and which had paid contributions into such fund under the State law with respect to such service performed in its employ before January 1, 1969, is not required to make any such payment (in lieu of contributions) on account of compensation paid after its election as heretofore described which is attributable under the State law to service performed in its employ, until the total of such compensation equals the amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by which the contributions paid by such organization (or group) with respect to a period before the election provided by section 3309(a)(2), exceed</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the unemployment compensation for the same period which was charged to the experience-rating account of such organization (or group) or paid under the State law on the basis of wages paid by it or service performed in its employ, whichever is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transitional rule for Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To facilitate the orderly transition to coverage of service to which section 3309(a)(1)(A) applies by reason of the enactment of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976, a State law may provide that an organization (or group of organizations) which elects, when such election first becomes available under the State law with respect to such service, to make payments (in lieu of contributions) into the State unemployment fund as provided in section 3309(a)(2), and which had paid contributions into such fund under the State law with respect to such service performed in its employ before the date of the enactment of this subsection, is not required to make any such payment (in lieu of contributions) on account of compensation paid after its election as heretofore described which is attributable under the State law to such service performed in its employ, until the total of such compensation equals the amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by which the contributions paid by such organization (or group) on the basis of wages for such service with respect to a period before the election provided by section 3309(a)(2), exceed</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the unemployment compensation for the same period which was charged to the experience-rating account of such organization (or group) or paid under the State law on the basis of such service performed in its employ or wages paid for such service, whichever is appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Treatment of certain stock purchases</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Acquisition by related corporation (other than subsidiary)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of sections 302 and 303, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) one or more persons are in control of each of two corporations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in return for property, one of the corporations acquires stock in the other corporation from the person (or persons) so in control,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then (unless paragraph (2) applies) such property shall be treated as a distribution in redemption of the stock of the corporation acquiring such stock. To the extent that such distribution is treated as a distribution to which section 301 applies, the stock so acquired shall be treated as having been transferred by the person from whom acquired, and as having been received by the corporation acquiring it, as a contribution to the capital of such corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Acquisition by subsidiary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of sections 302 and 303, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in return for property, one corporation acquires from a shareholder of another corporation stock in such other corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the issuing corporation controls the acquiring corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then such property shall be treated as a distribution in redemption of the stock of the issuing corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules for application of subsection (a)</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Rules for determinations under section 302(b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any acquisition of stock to which subsection (a) of this section applies, determinations as to whether the acquisition is, by reason of section 302(b), to be treated as a distribution in part or full payment in exchange for the stock shall be made by reference to the stock of the issuing corporation. In applying section 318(a) (relating to constructive ownership of stock) with respect to section 302(b) for purposes of this paragraph, sections 318(a)(2)(C) and 318(a)(3)(C) shall be applied without regard to the 50 percent limitation contained therein.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount constituting dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any acquisition of stock to which subsection (a) applies, the determination of the amount which is a dividend (and the source thereof) shall be made as if the property were distributed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by the acquiring corporation to the extent of its earnings and profits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) then by the issuing corporation to the extent of its earnings and profits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Coordination with section 351</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Property treated as received in redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, subsection (a) (and not section 351 and not so much of sections 357 and 358 as relates to section 351) shall apply to any property received in a distribution described in subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain assumptions of liability, etc.</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of an acquisition described in section 351, subsection (a) shall not apply to any liability&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) assumed by the acquiring corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to which the stock is subject,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;if such liability was incurred by the transferor to acquire the stock. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;stock&rdquo; means stock referred to in paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(A) of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Extension of obligations, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), an extension, renewal, or refinancing of a liability which meets the requirements of clause (i) shall be treated as meeting such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Clause (i) does not apply to stock acquired from related person except where complete termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Clause (i) shall apply only to stock acquired by the transferor from a person&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) who satisfies rules similar to the rules of section 302(c)(2) with respect to both the acquiring and the issuing corporations (determined as if such person were a distributee of each such corporation).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Distributions incident to formation of bank holding companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) pursuant to a plan, control of a bank is acquired and within 2 years after the date on which such control is acquired, stock constituting control of such bank is transferred to a BHC in connection with its formation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) incident to the formation of the BHC there is a distribution of property described in subsection (a), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the shareholders of the BHC who receive distributions of such property do not have control of such BHC,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then, subsection (a) shall not apply to any securities received by a qualified minority shareholder incident to the formation of <!-- PDFPage:662 -->such BHC. For purposes of this subparagraph, any assumption of (or acquisition of stock subject to) a liability under subparagraph (B) shall not be treated as a distribution of property.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Definitions and special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (C) and this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Qualified minority shareholder</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any transfer described in subsection (a) of stock from 1 member of an affiliated group to another member of such group, proper adjustments shall be made to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the adjusted basis of any intragroup stock, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the earnings and profits of any member of such group,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Control</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, control means the ownership of stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock. If a person (or persons) is in control (within the meaning of the preceding sentence) of a corporation which in turn owns at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all stock entitled to vote of another corporation, or owns at least 50 percent of the total value of the shares of all classes of stock of another corporation, then such person (or persons) shall be treated as in control of such other corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a)(1)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where 1 or more persons in control of the issuing corporation transfer stock of such corporation in exchange for stock of the acquiring corporation, the stock of the acquiring corporation received shall be taken into account in determining whether such person or persons are in control of the acquiring corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definition of control group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where 2 or more persons in control of the issuing corporation transfer stock of such corporation to the acquiring corporation and, after the transfer, the transferors are in control of the acquiring corporation, the person or persons in control of each corporation shall include each of the persons who so transfer stock.</p>

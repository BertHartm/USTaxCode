<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any sale of qualified small business stock held by an individual for more than 6 months and with respect to which such individual elects the application of this section, gain from such sale shall be recognized only to the extent that the amount realized on such sale exceeds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the cost of any qualified small business stock purchased by the taxpayer during the 60-day period beginning on the date of such sale, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any portion of such cost previously taken into account under this section.</p>

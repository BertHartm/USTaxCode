<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subsection, two or more banks which are members of the same affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504) shall be treated as one bank for the period of affiliation with respect to any fund of which any of the member banks is trustee or two or more of the member banks are cotrustees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taxation of common trust funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A common trust fund shall not be subject to taxation under this chapter and for purposes of this chapter shall not be considered a corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Income of participants in fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each participant in the common trust fund in computing its taxable income shall include, whether or not distributed and whether or not distributable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as part of its gains and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets held for not more than 1 year, its proportionate share of the gains and losses of the common trust fund from sales or exchanges of capital assets held for not more than 1 year,</p>

The withdrawal of any participating interest by a participant shall be treated as a sale or exchange of such interest by the participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Different taxable years of common trust fund and participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxable year of the common trust fund is different from that of a participant, the inclusions with respect to the taxable income of the common trust fund, in computing the taxable income of the participant for its taxable year, shall be based upon the taxable income of the common trust fund for any taxable year of the common trust fund ending within or with the taxable year of the participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Net operating loss deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The benefit of the deduction for net operating losses provided by section 172 shall not be allowed to a common trust fund, but shall be allowed to the participants in the common trust fund under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such stock is distributed by such common trust fund to participants in such common trust fund in exchange solely for their interests in such common trust fund,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">no gain or loss shall be recognized by such common trust fund by reason of such transfer or distribution, and no gain or loss shall be recognized by any participant in such common trust fund by reason of such exchange.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1143 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Basis rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Regulated investment company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The basis of any asset received by a regulated investment company in a transfer referred to in paragraph (1)(A) shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the common trust fund.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The basis of the stock which is received in an exchange referred to in paragraph (1)(B) shall be the same as that of the property exchanged. If stock in more than one regulated investment company is received in such exchange, the basis determined under the preceding sentence shall be allocated among the stock in each such company on the basis of respective fair market values.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of assumptions of liability</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining whether the transfer referred to in paragraph (1)(A) is in exchange solely for stock in one or more regulated investment companies, the assumption by any such company of a liability of the common trust fund, and the fact that any property transferred by the common trust fund is subject to a liability, shall be disregarded.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule where assumed liabilities exceed basis</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If, in any transfer referred to in paragraph (1)(A), the assumed liabilities exceed the aggregate adjusted bases (in the hands of the common trust fund) of the assets transferred to the regulated investment company or companies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) notwithstanding paragraph (1), gain shall be recognized to the common trust fund on such transfer in an amount equal to such excess,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the basis of the assets received by the regulated investment company or companies in such transfer shall be increased by the amount so recognized, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) any adjustment to the basis of a participant's interest in the common trust fund as a result of the gain so recognized shall be treated as occurring immediately before the exchange referred to in paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;If the transfer referred to in paragraph (1)(A) is to two or more regulated investment companies, the basis increase under subclause (II) shall be allocated among such companies on the basis of the respective fair market values of the assets received by each of such companies.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Assumed liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;assumed liabilities&rdquo; means the aggregate of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) any liability of the common trust fund assumed by any regulated investment company in connection with the transfer referred to in paragraph (1)(A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any liability to which property so transferred is subject.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Common trust fund must meet diversification rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to any common trust fund which would not meet the requirements of section 368(a)(2)(F)(ii) if it were a corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Government securities shall not be treated as securities of an issuer in applying the 25-percent and 50-percent test and such securities shall not be excluded for purposes of determining total assets under clause (iv) of section 368(a)(2)(F).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Taxable year of common trust fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, the taxable year of any common trust fund shall be the calendar year.</p>

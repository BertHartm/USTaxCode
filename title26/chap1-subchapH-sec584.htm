<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) as a trustee, executor, administrator, or guardian, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as a custodian of accounts&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to which the bank establishes, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that it has duties and responsibilities similar to duties and responsibilities of a trustee or guardian; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subsection, two or more banks which are members of the same affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504) shall be treated as one bank for the period of affiliation with respect to any fund of which any of the member banks is trustee or two or more of the member banks are cotrustees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taxation of common trust funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A common trust fund shall not be subject to taxation under this chapter and for purposes of <!-- PDFPage:1090 -->this chapter shall not be considered a corporation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Net operating loss deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The benefit of the deduction for net operating losses provided by section 172 shall not be allowed to a common trust fund, but shall be allowed to the participants in the common trust fund under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

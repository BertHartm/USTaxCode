<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exchanges generally</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exchanges subject to the provisions of section 1081(a) or (e)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the property was acquired on an exchange subject to the provisions of section 1081(a) or (e), or the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, the basis shall be the same as in the case of the property exchanged, decreased in the amount of any money received by the taxpayer, and increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss to the taxpayer that was recognized on such exchange under the law applicable to the year in which the exchange was made. If the property so acquired consisted in part of the <!-- PDFPage:1662 -->type of property permitted by section 1081(a) to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, and in part of nonexempt property, the basis provided in this subsection shall be allocated between the properties (other than money) received, and for the purpose of the allocation there shall be assigned to such nonexempt property (other than money) an amount equivalent to its fair market value at the date of the exchange. This subsection shall not apply to property acquired by a corporation by the issuance of its stock or securities as the consideration in whole or in part for the transfer of the property to it.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exchanges subject to the provisions of section 1081(b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The gain not recognized on a transfer by reason of section 1081(b) or the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws shall be applied to reduce the basis for determining gain or loss on sale or exchange of the following categories of property in the hands of the transferor immediately after the transfer, and property acquired within 24 months after such transfer by an expenditure or investment to which section 1081(b) relates on account of the acquisition of which gain is not recognized under such subsection, in the following order:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) property (not described in subparagraph (A)) with respect to which a deduction for amortization is allowable under section 169;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) property with respect to which a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 611 but not allowable under section 613;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) stock and securities of corporations not members of the system group of which the transferor is a member (other than stock or securities of a corporation of which the transferor is a subsidiary);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) securities (other than stock) of corporations which are members of the system group of which the transferor is a member (other than securities of the transferor or of a corporation of which the transferor is a subsidiary);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) stock of corporations which are members of the system group of which the transferor is a member (other than stock of the transferor or of a corporation of which the transferor is a subsidiary);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) all other remaining property of the transferor (other than stock or securities of the transferor or of a corporation of which the transferor is a subsidiary).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The manner and amount of the reduction to be applied to particular property within any of the categories described in subparagraphs (A) to (G), inclusive, shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Basis in case of pre-1942 acquisition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2), if the property was acquired in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1942, in any manner described in section 372 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 before its amendment by the Revenue Act of 1942, the basis shall be that prescribed in such section (before its amendment by such Act) with respect to such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfers to corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in connection with a transfer subject to the provisions of section 1081(a), (b), or (e) or the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, the property was acquired by a corporation, either as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital, or in consideration for stock or securities issued by the corporation receiving the property (including cases where part of the consideration for the transfer of such property to the corporation consisted of property or money in addition to such stock or securities), then the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss recognized to the transferor on such transfer under the law applicable to the year in which the transfer was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Distributions of stock or securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the stock or securities were received in a distribution subject to the provisions of section 1081(c) or the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, then the basis in the case of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made shall be apportioned, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, between such stock and the stock or securities distributed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfers within system group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the property was acquired by a corporation which is a member of a system group on a transfer or distribution described in section 1081(d)(1), then the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor; except that if such property is stock or securities issued by the corporation from which such stock or securities were received and they were issued&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as the sole consideration for the property transferred to such corporation, then the basis of such stock or securities shall be either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the same as in the case of the property transferred therefor, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the fair market value of such stock or securities at the time of their receipt, whichever is the lower; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as part consideration for the property transferred to such corporation, then the basis of such stock or securities shall be either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an amount which bears the same ratio to the basis of the property transferred as the fair market value of such stock or securities at the time of their receipt bears to the total fair market value of the entire consideration received, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the fair market value of such stock or securities at the time of their receipt, whichever is the lower.</p>

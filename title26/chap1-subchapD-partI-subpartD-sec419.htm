<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of such gross income, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the tax imposed by this chapter on the fund for the taxable year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the limitation of subsection (b),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">such excess shall be treated as an amount paid by the employer to such fund during the succeeding taxable year.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of amounts held pursuant to certain insurance contracts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraph (3)(C), the term &ldquo;fund&rdquo; shall not include amounts held by an insurance company pursuant to an insurance contract if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such contract is a life insurance contract described in section 264(a)(1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such contract is a qualified nonguaranteed contract.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified nonguaranteed contract</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;qualified nonguaranteed contract&rdquo; means any insurance contract (including a reasonable premium stabilization reserve held thereunder) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) there is no guarantee of a renewal of such contract, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) other than insurance protection, the only payments to which the employer or employees are entitled are experience rated refunds or policy dividends which are not guaranteed and which are determined by factors other than the amount of welfare benefits paid to (or on behalf of) the employees of the employer or their beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of any qualified nonguaranteed contract, subparagraph (A) shall not apply unless the amount of any experience rated refund or policy dividend payable to an employer with respect to a policy year is treated by the employer as received or accrued in the taxable year in which the policy year ends.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Method of contributions, etc., having the effect of a plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is no plan, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is a method or arrangement of employer contributions or benefits which has the effect of a plan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">this section shall apply as if there were a plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Extension to plans for independent contractors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any fund would be a welfare benefit fund (as modified by subsection (f)) but for the fact that there is no employee-employer relationship&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) this section shall apply as if there were such a relationship, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any reference in this section to the employer shall be treated as a reference to the <!-- PDFPage:902 -->person for whom services are provided, and any reference in this section to an employee shall be treated as a reference to the person providing the services.</p>

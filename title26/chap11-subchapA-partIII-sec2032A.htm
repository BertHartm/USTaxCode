<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, on the date of the decedent's death, the requirements of paragraph (1)(C)(ii) with respect to the decedent for any property are not met, and the decedent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was receiving old-age benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for a continuous period ending on such date, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If property is qualified real property with respect to a decedent (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the &ldquo;first decedent&ldquo;) and such property was acquired from or passed from the first decedent to the surviving spouse of the first decedent, for purposes of applying this subsection and subsection (c) in the case of the estate of such surviving spouse, active management of the farm or other business by the surviving spouse shall be treated as material participation by such surviving spouse in the operation of such farm or business. For purposes of subsection (c), such surviving spouse shall not be treated as failing to use such property in a qualified use solely because such spouse rents such property to a member of such spouse's family on a net cash basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the determination of whether property is qualified real property with respect to the first decedent shall be made without regard to subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) and without regard to whether an election under this section was made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Coordination with paragraph (4)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which to do so will enable the requirements of paragraph (1)(C)(ii) to be met with respect to the surviving spouse, this subsection and subsection (c) shall be applied by taking into account any application of paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tax treatment of dispositions and failures to use for qualified use</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of additional estate tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, within 10 years after the decedent's death and before the death of the qualified heir&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the qualified heir disposes of any interest in qualified real property (other than by a disposition to a member of his family), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the qualified heir ceases to use for the qualified use the qualified real property which was acquired (or passed) from the decedent,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then, there is hereby imposed an additional estate tax.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of additional tax</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of the additional tax imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to any interest shall be the amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the adjusted tax difference attributable to such interest, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the excess of the amount realized with respect to the interest (or, in any case other than a sale or exchange at arm's length, the fair market value of the interest) over the value of the interest determined under subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjusted tax difference attributable to interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the adjusted tax difference attributable to an interest is the amount which bears the same ratio to the adjusted tax difference with respect to the estate (determined under subparagraph (C)) as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the excess of the value of such interest for purposes of this chapter (determined without regard to subsection (a)) over the value of such interest determined under subsection (a), bears to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a similar excess determined for all qualified real property.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1736 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjusted tax difference with respect to the estate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (B), the term &ldquo;adjusted tax difference with respect to the estate&rdquo; means the excess of what would have been the estate tax liability but for subsection (a) over the estate tax liability.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, where the qualified heir disposes of a portion of the interest acquired by (or passing to) such heir (or a predecessor qualified heir) or there is a cessation of use of such a portion&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the value determined under subsection (a) taken into account under subparagraph (A)(ii) with respect to such portion shall be its pro rata share of such value of such interest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the adjusted tax difference attributable to the interest taken into account with respect to the transaction involving the second or any succeeding portion shall be reduced by the amount of the tax imposed by this subsection with respect to all prior transactions involving portions of such interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of qualified woodland to which an election under subsection (e)(13)(A) applies, if the qualified heir disposes of (or severs) any standing timber on such qualified woodland&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such disposition (or severance) shall be treated as a disposition of a portion of the interest of the qualified heir in such property, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the amount realized on such disposition (or, in any case other than a sale or exchange at arm's length, the fair market value of the portion of the interest disposed or severed), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the amount of additional tax determined under this paragraph (without regard to this subparagraph) if the entire interest of the qualified heir in the qualified woodland had been disposed of, less the sum of the amount of the additional tax imposed with respect to all prior transactions involving such woodland to which this subparagraph applied.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the disposition of a right to sever shall be treated as the disposition of the standing timber. The amount of additional tax imposed under paragraph (1) in any case in which a qualified heir disposes of his entire interest in the qualified woodland shall be reduced by any amount determined under this subparagraph with respect to such woodland.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Only 1 additional tax imposed with respect to any 1 portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an interest acquired from (or passing from) any decedent, if subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) applies to any portion of an interest, subparagraph (B) or (A), as the case may be, of paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the same portion of such interest.</p>

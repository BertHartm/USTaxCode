<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Arbitrage bond defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of section 103, the term &ldquo;arbitrage bond&rdquo; means any bond issued as part of an issue any portion of the proceeds of which are reasonably expected (at the time of issuance of the bond) to be used directly or indirectly&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to acquire higher yielding investments, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to replace funds which were used directly or indirectly to acquire higher yielding investments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subsection, a bond shall be treated as an arbitrage bond if the issuer intentionally uses any portion of the proceeds of the issue of which such bond is a part in a manner described in paragraph (1) or (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Higher yielding investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;higher yielding investments&rdquo; means any investment property which produces a yield over the term of the issue which is materially higher than the yield on the issue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Investment property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;investment property&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Alternative minimum tax bonds treated as investment property in certain cases</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary period exception</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a), a bond shall not be treated as an arbitrage bond solely by reason of the fact that the proceeds of the issue of which such bond is a part may be invested in higher yielding investments for a reasonable temporary period until such proceeds are needed for the purpose for which such issue was issued.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on temporary period for pooled financings</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The temporary period referred to in paragraph (1) shall not exceed 6 months with respect to the proceeds of an issue which are to be used to make or finance loans (other than nonpurpose investments) to 2 or more persons.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a), a bond shall not be treated as an arbitrage bond solely by reason of the fact that an amount of the proceeds of the issue of which such bond is a part may be invested in higher yielding investments which are part of a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Minor portion may be invested in higher yielding investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsections (a), (c), and (d), a bond issued as part of an issue shall not be treated as an arbitrage bond solely by reason of the fact that an amount of the proceeds of such issue (in addition to the amounts under subsections (c) and (d)) is invested in higher yielding investments if such amount does not exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 5 percent of the proceeds of the issue, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount earned on all nonpurpose investments (other than investments attributable to an excess described in this subparagraph), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount which would have been earned if such nonpurpose investments were invested at a rate equal to the yield on the issue, plus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any income attributable to the excess described in subparagraph (A),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">is paid to the United States by the issuer in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Due date of payments under paragraph (2)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except to the extent provided by the Secretary, the amount which is required to be paid to the United States by the issuer shall be paid in installments which are made at least once every 5 years. Each installment shall be in an amount which ensures that 90 percent of the amount described in paragraph (2) with respect to the issue at the time payment of such installment is required will have been paid to the United States. The last installment shall be made no later than 60 days after the day on which the last bond of the issue is redeemed and shall be in an amount sufficient to pay the remaining balance of the amount described in paragraph (2) with respect to such issue. A series of issues which are redeemed during a 6-month period (or such longer period as the Secretary may prescribe) shall be treated (at the election of the issuer) as 1 issue for purposes of the preceding sentence if no bond which is part of any issue in such series has a maturity of more than 270 <!-- PDFPage:411 -->days or is a private activity bond. In the case of a tax and revenue anticipation bond, the last installment shall not be required to be made before the date 8 months after the date of issuance of the issue of which the bond is a part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rules for applying paragraph (2)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the aggregate amount earned on nonpurpose investments for purposes of paragraph (2)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any gain or loss on the disposition of a nonpurpose investment shall be taken into account, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any amount earned on a bona fide debt service fund shall not be taken into account if the gross earnings on such fund for the bond year is less than $100,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In the case of an issue no bond of which is a private activity bond, clause (ii) shall be applied without regard to the dollar limitation therein if the average maturity of the issue (determined in accordance with section 147(b)(2)(A)) is at least 5 years and the rates of interest on bonds which are part of the issue do not vary during the term of the issue.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Temporary investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the requirements of paragraph (2) are met with respect to amounts not required to be spent as provided in subclause (I) (other than earnings on amounts in any bona fide debt service fund).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;Gross proceeds which are held in a bona fide debt service fund or a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund, and gross proceeds which arise after such 6 months and which were not reasonably anticipated as of the date of issuance, shall not be considered gross proceeds for purposes of subclause (I) only.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Additional period for certain bonds</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of an issue described in subclause (II), clause (i) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;1 year&rdquo; for &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; each place it appears with respect to the portion of the proceeds of the issue which are not expended in accordance with clause (i) if such portion does not exceed 5 percent of the proceeds of the issue.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the issuer has made the election under clause (viii), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the issuer makes an election under this clause before the close of the initial temporary period and not later than 90 days after the date the construction is substantially completed,</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(x) Failure to pay penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a failure (which is not due to willful neglect) to pay any penalty required to be paid under clause (vii) or (viii) in the amount or at the time prescribed therefor, the Secretary may treat such failure as not occurring if, in addition to paying such penalty, the issuer pays a penalty equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;The Secretary may waive all or any portion of the penalty under this clause. Bonds which are part of an issue with respect to which there is a failure to pay the amount required under this clause (and any refunding bond with respect thereto) shall be treated as not being, and as never having been, tax-exempt bonds.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(xi) Election for pooled financing bonds</h4>

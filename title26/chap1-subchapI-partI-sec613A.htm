<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Production of crude oil in excess of depletable oil quantity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the taxpayer's average daily production of domestic crude oil exceeds his depletable oil quantity, the allowance under paragraph (1)(A) with respect to oil produced during the taxable year from each property in the United States shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of depletion which would have been allowable under section 613(a) for all of the taxpayer's oil produced from such property during the taxable year (computed as if section 613 applied to all of such production at the rate specified in paragraph (1) or (6), as the case may be) as his depletable oil quantity bears to the aggregate number of barrels representing the average daily production of domestic crude oil of the taxpayer for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Production of natural gas in excess of depletable natural gas quantity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the taxpayer's average daily production of domestic natural gas exceeds his depletable natural gas quantity, the allowance under paragraph (1)(B) with respect to natural gas produced during the taxable year from each property in the United States shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of depletion which would have been allowable under section 613(a) for all of the taxpayers&nbsp;<sup><a href="#613A_1_target" name="613A_1">1</a></sup> natural gas produced from such property during the taxable year (computed as if section 613 applied to all of such production at the rate specified in paragraph (1) or (6), as the case may be) as the amount of his depletable natural gas quantity in cubic feet bears to the aggregate number of cubic feet representing the average daily production of domestic natural gas of the taxpayer for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Taxable income from the property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If both oil and gas are produced from the property during the taxable year, for purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B) the taxable income from the property, in applying the taxable income limitation in section 613(a), shall be allocated between the oil production and the gas production in proportion to the gross income during the taxable year from each.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Partnerships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a partnership, the depletion allowance shall be computed separately by the partners and not by the partnership. The partnership shall allocate to each partner his proportionate share of the adjusted basis of each partnership oil or gas property. The allocation is to be made as of the later of the date of acquisition of the oil or gas property by the partnership, or January 1, 1975. A partner's proportionate share of the adjusted basis of partnership property shall be determined in accordance with his interest in partnership capital or income and, in the case of property contributed to the partnership by a partner, section 704(c) (relating to contributed property) shall apply in determining such share. Each partner shall separately keep records of his share of the adjusted basis in each oil and gas property of the partnership, adjust such share of the adjusted basis for any depletion taken on such property, and use such adjusted basis each year in the computation of his cost depletion or in the computation of his gain or loss on the disposition of such property by the partnership. For purposes of section 732 (relating to basis of distributed property other than money), the partnership's adjusted basis in mineral property shall be an amount equal to the sum of the partners&rsquo; adjusted basis in such property as determined under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Business under common control; members of the same family</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Component members of controlled group treated as one taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, persons who are members of the same controlled group of corporations shall be treated as one taxpayer.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1110 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Aggregation of business entities under common control</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If 50 percent or more of the beneficial interest in two or more corporations, trusts, or estates is owned by the same or related persons (taking into account only persons who own at least 5 percent of such beneficial interest), the tentative quantity determined under paragraph (3)(B) shall be allocated among all such entities in proportion to the respective production of domestic crude oil during the period in question by such entities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Allocation among members of the same family</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of individuals who are members of the same family, the tentative quantity determined under paragraph (3)(B) shall be allocated among such individuals in proportion to the respective production of domestic crude oil during the period in question by such individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Definition and special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the term &ldquo;controlled group of corporations&rdquo; has the meaning given to such term by section 1563(a), except that section 1563(b)(2) shall not apply and except that &ldquo;more than 50 percent&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;at least 80 percent&rdquo; each place it appears in section 1563(a),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a person is a related person to another person if such persons are members of the same controlled group of corporations or if the relationship between such persons would result in a disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707(b), except that for this purpose the family of an individual includes only his spouse and minor children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the family of an individual includes only his spouse and minor children, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) each 6,000 cubic feet of domestic natural gas shall be treated as 1 barrel of domestic crude oil.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Special rule for fiscal year taxpayers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In applying this subsection to a taxable year which is not a calendar year, each portion of such taxable year which occurs during a single calendar year shall be treated as if it were a short taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Certain production not taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In applying this subsection, there shall not be taken into account the production of natural gas with respect to which subsection (b) applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Subchapter S corporations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Computation of depletion allowance at shareholder level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an S corporation, the allowance for depletion with respect to any oil or gas property shall be computed separately by each shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allocation of basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The S corporation shall allocate to each shareholder his pro rata share of the adjusted basis of the S corporation in each oil or gas property held by the S corporation. The allocation shall be made as of the later of the date of acquisition of the property by the S corporation, or the first day of the first taxable year of the S corporation to which the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 applies. Each shareholder shall separately keep records of his share of the adjusted basis in each oil and gas property of the S corporation, adjust such share of the adjusted basis for any depletion taken on such property, and use such adjusted basis each year in the computation of his cost depletion or in the computation of his gain or loss on the disposition of such property by the S corporation. In the case of any distribution of oil or gas property to its shareholders by the S corporation, the corporation's adjusted basis in the property shall be an amount equal to the sum of the shareholders&rsquo; adjusted bases in such property, as determined under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitations on application of subsection (c)</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation based on taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The deduction for the taxable year attributable to the application of subsection (c) shall not exceed 65 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income for the year computed without regard to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any depletion on production from an oil or gas property which is subject to the provisions of subsection (c),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any net operating loss carryback to the taxable year under section 172,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any capital loss carryback to the taxable year under section 1212, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a trust, any distributions to its beneficiary, except in the case of any trust where any beneficiary of such trust is a member of the family (as defined in section 267(c)(4)) of a settlor who created inter vivos and testamentary trusts for members of the family and such settlor died within the last six days of the fifth month in 1970, and the law in the jurisdiction in which such trust was created requires all or a portion of the gross or net proceeds of any royalty or other interest in oil, gas, or other mineral representing any percentage depletion allowance to be allocated to the principal of the trust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If an amount is disallowed as a deduction for the taxable year by reason of application of the preceding sentence, the disallowed amount shall be treated as an amount allowable as a deduction under subsection (c) for the following taxable year, subject to the application of the preceding sentence to such taxable year. For purposes of basis adjustments and determining whether cost depletion exceeds percentage depletion with respect to the production from a property, any amount disallowed as a deduction on the application of this paragraph shall be allocated to the respective properties from which the oil or gas was produced in proportion to the percentage depletion otherwise allowable to such properties under subsection (c).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1111 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Retailers excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (c) shall not apply in the case of any taxpayer who directly, or through a related person, sells oil or natural gas (excluding bulk sales of such items to commercial or industrial users), or any product derived from oil or natural gas (excluding bulk sales of aviation fuels to the Department of Defense)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) through any retail outlet operated by the taxpayer or a related person, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to any person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) obligated under an agreement or contract with the taxpayer or a related person to use a trademark, trade name, or service mark or name owned by such taxpayer or a related person, in marketing or distributing oil or natural gas or any product derived from oil or natural gas, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) given authority, pursuant to an agreement or contract with the taxpayer or a related person, to occupy any retail outlet owned, leased, or in any way controlled by the taxpayer or a related person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding sentence this paragraph shall not apply in any case where the combined gross receipts from the sale of such oil, natural gas, or any product derived therefrom, for the taxable year of all retail outlets taken into account for purposes of this paragraph do not exceed $5,000,000. For purposes of this paragraph, sales of oil, natural gas, or any product derived from oil or natural gas shall not include sales made of such items outside the United States, if no domestic production of the taxpayer or a related person is exported during the taxable year or the immediately preceding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Related person</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a person is a related person with respect to the taxpayer if a significant ownership interest in either the taxpayer or such person is held by the other, or if a third person has a significant ownership interest in both the taxpayer and such person. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;significant ownership interest&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

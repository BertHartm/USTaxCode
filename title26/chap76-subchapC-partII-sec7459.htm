<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A report upon any proceeding instituted before the Tax Court and a decision thereon shall be made as quickly as practicable. The decision shall be made by a judge in accordance with the report of the Tax Court, and such decision so made shall, when entered, be the decision of the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inclusion of findings of fact or opinions in report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the Tax Court and of each division to include in its report upon any proceeding its findings of fact or opinion or memorandum opinion. The Tax Court shall report in writing all its findings of fact, opinions, and memorandum opinions. Subject to such conditions as the Tax Court may by rule provide, the requirements of this subsection and of section 7460 are met if findings of fact or opinion are stated orally and recorded in the transcript of the proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Date of decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A decision of the Tax Court (except a decision dismissing a proceeding for lack of jurisdiction) shall be held to be rendered upon the date that an order specifying the amount of the deficiency is entered in the records of the Tax Court or, in the case of a declaratory judgment proceeding under part IV of this subchapter or under section 7428 or in the case of an action brought under section 6226 or section 6228(a), the date of the court's order entering the decision. If the Tax Court dismisses a proceeding for reasons other than lack of jurisdiction and is unable from the record to determine the amount of the deficiency determined by the Secretary, or if the Tax Court dismisses a proceeding for lack of jurisdiction, an order to that effect shall be entered in the records of the Tax Court, and the decision of the Tax Court shall be held to be rendered upon the date of such entry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect of decision dismissing petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a petition for a redetermination of a deficiency has been filed by the taxpayer, a decision of the Tax Court dismissing the proceeding shall be considered as its decision that the deficiency is the amount determined by the Secretary. An order specifying such amount shall be entered in the records of the Tax Court unless the Tax Court cannot determine such amount from the record in the proceeding, or unless the dismissal is for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of decision that tax is barred by limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the assessment or collection of any tax is barred by any statute of limitations, the decision of the Tax Court to that effect shall be considered as its decision that there is no deficiency in respect of such tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Findings of fact as evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The findings of the Board of Tax Appeals made in connection with any decision prior to February 26, 1926, shall, notwithstanding the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 9), continue to be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Penalty</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For penalty for taxpayer instituting proceedings before Tax Court merely for delay, see section 6673.</strong></p>

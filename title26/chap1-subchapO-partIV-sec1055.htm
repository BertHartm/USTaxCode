<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the leaseholder has a present or future right to terminate, and to acquire the entire interest of the lessor in the land, by payment of a determined or determinable amount, which right exists by virtue of State or local law and not because of any private agreement or privately created condition, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the lessor's interest in the land is primarily a security interest to protect the rental payments to which the lessor is entitled under the lease.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Anti-abuse rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;amortizable section 197 intangible&rdquo; does not include any section 197 intangible acquired in a transaction, one of the principal purposes of which is to avoid the requirement of subsection (c)(1) that the intangible be acquired after the date of the enactment of this section or to avoid the provisions of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section, including such regulations as may be appropriate to prevent avoidance of the purposes of this section through related persons or otherwise.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) General written determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;general written determination&rdquo; means any written determination other than a reference written determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemptions from disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before making any written determination or background file document open or available to public inspection under subsection (a), the Secretary shall delete&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the names, addresses, and other identifying details of the person to whom the written determination pertains and of any other person, other than a person with respect to whom a notation is made under subsection (d)(1), identified in the written determination or any background file document;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) information specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and which is in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall determine the appropriate extent of such deletions and, except in the case of intentional or willful disregard of this subsection, shall not be required to make such deletions (nor be liable for failure to make deletions) unless the Secretary has agreed to such deletions or has been ordered by a court (in a proceeding under subsection (f)(3)) to make such deletions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedures with regard to third party contacts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, before the issuance of a written determination, the Internal Revenue Service receives any communication (written or otherwise) concerning such written determination, any request for such determination, or any other matter involving such written determination from a person other than an employee of the Internal Revenue Service or the person to whom such written determination pertains (or his authorized representative with regard to such written determination), the Internal Revenue Service shall indicate, on the written determination open to public inspection, the category of the person making such communication and the date of such communication.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disclosure of identity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any written determination to which paragraph (1) applies, any person may file a petition in the United States Tax Court or file a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for an order requiring that the identity of any person to whom the written determination pertains be disclosed. The court shall order disclosure of such identity if there is evidence in the record from which one could reasonably conclude that an impropriety occurred or undue influence was exercised with respect to such written determination by or on behalf of such person. The court may also direct the Secretary to disclose any portion of any other deletions made in accordance with subsection (c) where such disclosure is in the public interest. If a proceeding is commenced under this paragraph, the person whose identity is subject to being disclosed and the person about whom a notation is made under paragraph (1) shall be notified of the proceeding in accordance with the procedures described in subsection (f)(4)(B) and shall have the right to intervene in the proceeding (anonymously, if appropriate).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Period in which to bring action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No proceeding shall be commenced under paragraph (3) unless a petition is filed before the expiration of 36 months after the first day that the written determination is open to public inspection.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice of intention to disclose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall upon issuance of any written determination, or upon receipt of a request for a background file document, mail a <!-- PDFPage:2410 -->notice of intention to disclose such determination or document to any person to whom the written determination pertains (or a successor in interest, executor, or other person authorized by law to act for or on behalf of such person).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Administrative remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations establishing administrative remedies with respect to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Action to restrain disclosure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Creation of remedy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to whom a written determination pertains (or a successor in interest, executor, or other person authorized by law to act for or on behalf of such person), or who has a direct interest in maintaining the confidentiality of any such written determination or background file document (or portion thereof),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) who disagrees with any failure to make a deletion with respect to that portion of any written determination or any background file document which is to be open or available to public inspection, and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice to certain persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall notify any person to whom a written determination pertains (unless such person is the petitioner) of the filing of a petition under this paragraph with respect to such written determination or related background file document, and any such person may intervene (anonymously, if appropriate) in any proceeding conducted pursuant to this paragraph. The Secretary shall send such notice by registered or certified mail to the last known address of such person within 15 days after such petition is served on the Secretary. No person who has received such a notice may thereafter file any petition under this paragraph with respect to such written determination or background file document with respect to which such notice was received.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Action to obtain additional disclosure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Creation of remedy</h4>

The burden of proof with respect to the issue of disclosure of any information shall be on the Secretary and any other person seeking to restrain disclosure.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Intervention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a proceeding is commenced under this paragraph with respect to any written determination or background file document, the Secretary shall, within 15 days after notice of the petition filed under subparagraph (A) is served on him, send notice of the commencement of such proceeding to all persons who are identified by name and address in such written determination or background file document.

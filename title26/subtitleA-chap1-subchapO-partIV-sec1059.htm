<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;extraordinary dividend&rdquo; means any dividend with respect to a share of stock if the amount of such dividend equals or exceeds the threshold percentage of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in such share of stock.</p>

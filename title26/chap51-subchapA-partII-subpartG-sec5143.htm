To secure the right to carry on the business without incurring additional special tax, the successor, or the person relocating his business, must register the succession or relocation with the Secretary in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Federal agencies or instrumentalities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any tax imposed by this part shall apply to any agency or instrumentality of the United States unless such agency or instrumentality is granted by statute a specific exemption from such tax.</p>

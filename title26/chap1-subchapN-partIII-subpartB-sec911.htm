<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a taxpayer engaged in a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a reasonable allowance as compensation for the personal services rendered by the taxpayer, not in excess of 30 percent of his share of the net profits of such trade or business, shall be considered as earned income.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) before meeting the requirements of such paragraph (1), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such individual could reasonably have been expected to have met such requirements but for the conditions referred to in clause (i) of subparagraph (B),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be treated as a qualified individual with respect to the period described in subparagraph (A) during which he was a bona fide resident of, or was present in, the foreign country, and in applying subsections (b)(2)(A) and (c)(1)(B)(ii) with respect to such individual, only the days within such period shall be taken into account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an individual who has earned income from sources within a foreign country submits a statement to the authorities of that country that he is not a resident of that country, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then such individual shall not be considered a bona fide resident of that country for purposes of paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Denial of double benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No deduction or exclusion from gross income under this subtitle or credit against the tax imposed by this chapter (including any credit or deduction for the amount of taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country or possession of the United States) shall be allowed to the extent such deduction, exclusion, or credit is properly allocable to or chargeable against amounts excluded from gross income under subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Aggregate benefit cannot exceed foreign earned income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The sum of the amount excluded under subsection (a) and the amount deducted under subsection (c)(3)(A) for the taxable year shall not exceed the individual's foreign earned income for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Limitation on income earned in restricted country</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If travel (or any transaction in connection with such travel) with respect to any foreign country is subject to the regulations described in subparagraph (B) during any period&mdash;</p>

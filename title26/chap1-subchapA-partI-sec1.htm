Under &sect;1(g)(4)(A)(ii), net unearned income generally equals unearned income less the sum of (I) the amount in effect for the tax year under &sect;63(c)(5)(A), plus (II) the greater of the amount described in (I) or certain itemized deductions.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">(2) The amount in effect for tax years beginning in 1995 under &sect;63(c)(5)(A) is $650. See section 3.04(2) below.

Section 132(f)(2)(A) limits the exclusion for the aggregate of the transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and the transit pass to $60 per month (the &ldquo;$60 vehicle/transit&rdquo; limitation). Section 132(f)(2)(B) limits the exclusion for qualified parking to $155 per month (the &ldquo;$155 parking&rdquo; limitation).</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">(2) For tax years beginning in 1995, the &ldquo;$60 vehicle/transit&rdquo; limitation is $60 and the &ldquo;$155 parking&rdquo; limitation is $160.</p>

The amount of the reduction in the exclusion caused by the phaseout is calculated by multiplying the amount otherwise excludable by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the excess of the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income over the threshold amount ($60,000 for joint returns or $40,000 for others) and the denominator is $30,000 for joint returns or $15,000 for others.</p>

The guidelines provide that insubstantial benefits received by the contributor (in the context of a charitable fund-raising campaign) are disregarded, which makes the contribution fully deductible under &sect;170.

<p class="italic-text-para">Under &sect;1(f)(3), the inflation adjustment for a calendar year is the percentage (if any) by which the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the preceding calendar year exceeds the CPI for the calendar year 1992. However, &sect;1(f)(7)(A) provides that in prescribing the inflation adjustments for the 36 percent and 39.6 percent tax rate brackets, the preceding calendar year's CPI is compared with the CPI for the <!-- PDFPage:30 -->calendar year 1993. For purposes of computing the inflation adjustment, &sect;1(f)(4) defines the CPI as the average of the 12 monthly CPIs for the 12-month period ending on August 31 of such calendar year.

Under &sect;1(f)(6), the adjusted &ldquo;applicable amount&rdquo; is &ldquo;rounded down&rdquo; to the nearest multiple of $50 ($25 in the case of married individuals filing separately).</p>

The preceding calendar year's CPI is compared with the CPI for the calendar year 1992.

The adjustment, before rounding, is the excess of (A) the &ldquo;$30,000 amount&rdquo; increased by the method described in &sect;1(f)(3), except that the preceding calendar year's CPI is compared with the CPI for the calendar year 1990, over (B) the dollar amount in effect under &sect;4001(a) for the calendar year.

<p class="italic-text-para">Section 4001(e)(1) further provides that the adjusted and rounded amount shall apply to the calendar year subsequent to the year on which the cost of living calculations are based. This means that the inflation adjustment factor for the $30,000 amount for tax years beginning in 1995 is computed by comparing the CPI for calendar year 1993 with the CPI for the calendar year 1990.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The gross income during the taxable year from any trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by the insurance company, or by a partnership of which the insurance company is a partner. In computing gross income under this paragraph, there shall be excluded any item described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In computing taxable investment income, the following deductions shall be allowed:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Tax-free interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of interest which under section 103 is excluded for the taxable year from gross income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Investment expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Investment expenses paid or accrued during the taxable year. If any general expenses are in part assigned to or included in the investment expenses, the total deduction under this paragraph shall not exceed one-fourth of 1 percent of the mean of the book value of the invested assets held at the beginning and end of the taxable year plus one-fourth of the amount by which taxable investment income (computed without any deduction for investment expenses allowed by this paragraph, for tax-free interest allowed by paragraph (1), or for dividends received allowed by paragraph (7)), exceeds 33/4 percent of the book value of the mean of the invested assets held at the beginning and end of the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Real estate expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Taxes (as provided in section 164), and other expenses, paid or accrued during the taxable year exclusively on or with respect to the real estate owned by the company.

<!-- PDFPage:1349 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Capital losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Capital losses to the extent provided in subchapter P (sec. 1201 and following) plus losses from capital assets sold or exchanged in order to obtain funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and similar distributions to policyholders. Capital assets shall be considered as sold or exchanged in order to obtain funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and similar distributions to policyholders to the extent that the gross receipts from their sale or exchange are not greater than the excess, if any, for the taxable year of the sum of dividends and similar distributions paid to policyholders, losses paid, and expenses paid over the sum of the items described in subsection (b) (other than paragraph (1)(D) thereof) and net premiums received. In the application of section 1212 for purposes of this section, the net capital loss for the taxable year shall be the amount by which losses for such year from sales or exchanges of capital assets exceeds the sum of the gains from such sales or exchanges and whichever of the following amounts is the lesser:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The deduction under subsection (c)(3) or (4) on account of any real estate owned and occupied in whole or in part by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 831 shall be limited to an amount which bears the same ratio to such deduction (computed without regard to this paragraph) as the rental value of the space not so occupied bears to the rental value of the entire property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amortization of premium and accrual of discount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The gross amount of income during the taxable year from interest and the deduction provided in subsection (c)(1) shall each be decreased to reflect the appropriate amortization of premium and increased to reflect the appropriate accrual of discount attributable to the taxable year on bonds, notes, debentures, or other evidences of indebtedness held by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 831. Such amortization and accrual shall be determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in accordance with the method regularly employed by such company, if such method is reasonable, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in all other cases, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Double deductions</h4>

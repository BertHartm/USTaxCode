For purposes of the preceding sentence, an individual shall have exhausted his rights to regular compensation under a State law (A) when no payments of regular compensation can be made under such law because such individual has received all regular compensation available to him based on employment or wages during his base period, or (B) when his rights to such compensation have terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with respect to which such rights existed.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Except where inconsistent with the provisions of this title, the terms and conditions of the State law which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof shall apply to claims for extended compensation and to the payment thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), payment of extended compensation under this Act [see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note set out under section 3311 of this title] shall not be made to any individual for any week of unemployment in his eligibility period&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(i) during which he fails to accept any offer of suitable work (as defined in subparagraph (c) [probably means subpar. (C)]) or fails to apply for any suitable work to which he was referred by the State agency; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(ii) during which he fails to actively engage in seeking work, unless such individual is not actively engaged in seeking work because such individual is, as determined in accordance with State law&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(I) before any court of the United States or any State pursuant to a lawfully issued summons to appear for jury duty (as such term may be defined by the Secretary of Labor), or</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(B) If any individual is ineligible for extended compensation for any week by reason of a failure described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), the individual shall be ineligible to receive extended compensation for any week which begins during a period which&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(i) begins with the week following the week in which such failure occurs, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(ii) does not end until such individual has been employed during at least 4 weeks which begin after such failure and the total of the remuneration earned by the individual for being so employed is not less than the product of 4 multiplied by the individual's average weekly benefit amount (as determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(c) [probably means subsec. (b)(1)(C)]) for his benefit year.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &lsquo;suitable work&rsquo; means, with respect to any individual, any work which is within such individual's capabilities; except that, if the individual furnishes evidence satisfactory to the State agency that such individual's prospects for obtaining work in his customary occupation within a reasonably short period are good, the determination of whether any work is suitable work with respect to such individual shall be made in accordance with the applicable State law.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(D) Extended compensation shall not be denied under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) to any individual for any week by reason of a failure to accept an offer of, or apply for, suitable work&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(i) if the gross average weekly remuneration payable to such individual for the position does not exceed the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(I) the individual's average weekly benefit amount (as determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(C)) for his benefit year, plus</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(II) the amount (if any) of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits (as defined in section 501(c)(17)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) payable to such individual for such week;</p>

For purposes of this paragraph, the equivalent in insured wages shall be earnings covered by the State law for compensation purposes which exceed 40 times the individual's most recent weekly benefit amount or 11/2 times the individual's insured wages in that calendar quarter of the base period in which the individual's insured wages were the highest (or one such quarter if his wages were the same for more than one such quarter). The State shall by law provide which one or more of the foregoing methods of measuring employment and earnings shall be used in that State.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) [Individual's Compensation Accounts] (1) The State law shall provide that the State will establish, for each eligible individual who files an application therefor, an extended compensation account with respect to such individual's benefit year. The amount established in such account shall be not less than whichever of the following is the least:</p>

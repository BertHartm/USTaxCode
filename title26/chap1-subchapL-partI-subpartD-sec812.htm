<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;100 percent dividend&rdquo; does not include any distribution by a corporation to the extent such distribution is out of tax-exempt interest or out of dividends which are not 100 percent dividends (determined with the application of this subparagraph).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain dividends received by foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;100 percent dividends&rdquo; does not include any dividend described in section 805(a)(4)(E) (relating to certain dividends in the case of foreign corporations).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) No double counting</h4>

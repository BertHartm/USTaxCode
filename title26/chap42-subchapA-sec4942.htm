<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Initial tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby imposed on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, which has not been distributed before the first day of the second (or any succeeding) taxable year following such taxable year (if such first day falls within the taxable period), a tax equal to 15 percent of the amount of such income remaining undistributed at the beginning of such second (or succeeding) taxable year. The tax imposed by this subsection shall not apply to the undistributed income of a private foundation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for any taxable year for which it is an operating foundation (as defined in subsection (j)(3)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent that the foundation failed to distribute any amount solely because of an incorrect valuation of assets under subsection (e), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the failure to value the assets properly was not willful and was due to reasonable cause,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such amount is distributed as qualifying distributions (within the meaning of subsection (g)) by the foundation during the allowable distribution period (as defined in subsection (j)(2)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the foundation notifies the Secretary that such amount has been distributed (within the meaning of subparagraph (B)) to correct such failure, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such distribution is treated under subsection (h)(2) as made out of the undistributed income for the taxable year for which a tax would (except for this paragraph) have been imposed under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which an initial tax is imposed under subsection (a) on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, if any portion of such income remains undistributed at the close of the taxable period, <!-- PDFPage:2187 -->there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 100 percent of the amount remaining undistributed at such time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Undistributed income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;undistributed income&rdquo; means, with respect to any private foundation for any taxable year as of any time, the amount by which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the acquisition indebtedness with respect to such assets (determined under section 514(c)(1) without regard to the taxable year in which the indebtedness was incurred).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Valuation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the fair market value of securities for which market quotations are readily available shall be determined on a monthly basis.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reductions in value for blockage or similar factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the value of any securities under this paragraph, the fair market value of such securities (determined without regard to any reduction in value) shall not be reduced unless, and only to the extent that, the private foundation establishes that as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the size of the block of such securities,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the fact that the securities held are securities in a closely held corporation, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the securities could not be liquidated within a reasonable period of time except at a price less than such fair market value. Any reduction in value allowable under this subparagraph shall not exceed 10 percent of such fair market value.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2)(B), the basis (for purposes of determining gain) of property held by a private foundation on December 31, 1969, and continuously thereafter to the date of its disposition, shall be deemed to be not <!-- PDFPage:2188 -->less than the fair market value of such property on December 31, 1969.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Qualifying distributions defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount paid to acquire an asset used (or held for use) directly in carrying out one or more purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain set-asides</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1975, subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary, an amount set aside for a specific project which comes within one or more purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) may be treated as a qualifying distribution if it meets the requirements of subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An amount set aside for a specific project shall meet the requirements of this subparagraph if at the time of the set-aside the foundation establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the amount will be paid for the specific project within 5 years, and either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at the time of the set-aside the private foundation establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the project is one which can better be accomplished by such set-aside than by immediate payment of funds, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) the project will not be completed before the end of the taxable year of the foundation in which the set-aside is made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the private foundation in each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975 (or after the end of the fourth taxable year following the year of its creation, whichever is later), distributes amounts, in cash or its equivalent, equal to not less than the distributable amount determined under subsection (d) (without regard to subsection (i)) for purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) (including but not limited to payments with respect to set-asides which were treated as qualifying distributions in one or more prior years), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) the private foundation has distributed (including but not limited to payments with respect to set-asides which were treated as qualifying distributions in one or more prior years) during the four taxable years immediately preceding its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, or the fifth taxable year following the year of its creation, whichever is later, an aggregate amount, in cash or its equivalent, of not less than the sum of the following: 80 percent of the first preceding taxable year's distributable amount; 60 percent of the second preceding taxable year's distributable amount; 40 percent of the third preceding taxable year's distributable amount; and 20 percent of the fourth preceding taxable year's distributable amount.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain failures to distribute</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the failure to distribute such amounts was not willful and was due to reasonable cause, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the foundation distributes an amount in cash or its equivalent which is not less than the difference between the amounts required to be distributed under clause (ii)(II) of subparagraph (B) and the amounts actually distributed in cash or its equivalent during that taxable year within the correction period (as defined in section 4963(e)),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">such distribution in cash or its equivalent shall be treated for the purposes of this subparagraph as made during such year.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:2189 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not later than the close of the first taxable year after its taxable year in which such contribution is received, such organization makes a distribution equal to the amount of such contribution and such distribution is a qualifying distribution (within the meaning of paragraph (1) or (2), without regard to this paragraph) which is treated under subsection (h) as a distribution out of corpus (or would be so treated if such section 501(c)(3) organization were a private foundation which is not an operating foundation), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the private foundation making the contribution obtains adequate records or other sufficient evidence from such organization showing that the qualifying distribution described in subparagraph (A) has been made by such organization.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">At the time of filing a petition for a declaratory judgment, a designation of place for submission to the Court shall be filed in accordance with Rule 140. In addition to including in the designation the information specified in Rule 140, the petitioner shall also include the date on which the petitioner expects the action will be ready for submission to the Court and the petitioner's estimate of the time required therefor. In cases involving a revocation or involving the status of a governmental obligation, the Commissioner shall, at the time the answer is filed, also set forth in a separate statement the date on which the Commissioner expects the action will be ready for submission to the Court and an estimate of the time required therefor. After the action becomes at issue (see Rule 214), it will ordinarily, without any further request by the Court for information as to readiness for submission, be placed on a calendar for submission to the Court. See Rule 217(b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Caption:</em> A proper caption shall be placed on all papers filed with the Court, and the requirements provided in Rule 32(a) shall be satisfied with respect to all such papers. All prefixes and titles, such as &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo;, shall be omitted from the caption. The full name and surname of each individual petitioner shall be set forth in the caption. The name of an estate or trust or other person for whom a fiduciary acts shall precede the fiduciary's name and title, as for example &ldquo;Estate of Mary Doe, deceased, Richard Roe, Executor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Date:</em> The date of signature shall be placed on all papers filed with the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Signature:</em> The original signature, either of the party or the party's counsel, shall be subscribed in writing to the original of every paper filed by or for that party with the Court, except as otherwise provided by these Rules. An individual rather than a firm name shall be used, except that the signature of a petitioner corporation or unincorporated association shall be in the name of the corporation or association by one of its active and authorized officers or members, as for example &ldquo;Mary Doe, Inc., by Richard Roe, President.&rdquo; The name, mailing address, and telephone number of the party or the party's counsel, as well as counsel's Tax Court bar number, shall be typed or printed immediately beneath the written signature.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Number Filed:</strong> For each paper filed in Court, there shall be filed four conformed copies together with the signed original thereof, except as otherwise provided in these Rules. Where filing is in more than one case (as a motion to consolidate, or in cases already consolidated), the number filed shall include one additional copy for each docket number in excess of one. As to stipulations, see Rule 91(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Legible Copies Required:</strong> Papers filed with the Court may be prepared by any process, but only if all papers, including copies, filed with the Court are clear and legible.</p>

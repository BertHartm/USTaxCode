<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Recapture in lieu of disallowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which, in lieu of disallowing a loss under subparagraph (A) for a prior taxable year, the gross income of the liquidating corporation for the taxable year in which the plan of complete liquidation is adopted shall be increased by the amount of the disallowed loss.</p>

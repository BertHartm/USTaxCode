The entire amount of the net capital loss for any taxable year shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which such loss may be carried, and the portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years to which such loss may be carried shall be the excess, if any, of such loss over the total of the capital gain net income for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be car<!-- PDFPage:1680 -->ried. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the capital gain net income for any such prior taxable year shall be computed without regard to the net capital loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter. In the case of any net capital loss which cannot be carried back in full to a preceding taxable year by reason of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), the capital gain net income for such prior taxable year shall in no case be treated as greater than the amount of such loss which can be carried back to such preceding taxable year upon the application of such clause (ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain for such year shall be a long-term capital loss in the succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of amounts allowed under section 1211(b)(1) or (2)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining the excess referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), there shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in the taxable year an amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Carryback of losses from section 1256 contracts to offset prior gains from such contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a taxpayer (other than a corporation) has a net section 1256 contracts loss for the taxable year and elects to have this subsection apply to such taxable year, the amount of such net section 1256 contracts loss&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be a carryback to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent that, after the application of paragraphs (2) and (3), such loss is allowed as a carryback to any such preceding taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 40 percent of the amount so allowed shall be treated as a short-term capital loss from section 1256 contracts, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 60 percent of the amount so allowed shall be treated as a long-term capital loss from section 1256 contracts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The entire amount of the net section 1256 contracts loss for any taxable year shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which such loss may be carried back under paragraph (1). The portion of such loss which <!-- PDFPage:1681 -->shall be carried to each of the 2 other taxable years to which such loss may be carried back shall be the excess (if any) of such loss over the portion of such loss which, after the application of paragraph (3), was allowed as a carryback for any prior taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amount which may be used in any prior taxable year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An amount shall be allowed as a carryback under paragraph (1) to any prior taxable year only to the extent&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The net section 1256 contract gain for any taxable year before the loss year shall be computed without regard to the net section 1256 contracts loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Qualifications:</strong> (1) <em>General:</em> An applicant for admission to practice before the Court must establish to the satisfaction of the Court that the applicant is of good moral character and repute and is possessed of the requisite qualifications to represent others in the preparation and trial of cases. In addition, the applicant must satisfy the further requirements of this Rule 200.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Attorneys:</em> An attorney at law may be admitted to practice upon filing with the Admissions Clerk a completed application accompanied by a fee of $25 and a current certificate from the Clerk of the appropriate court, showing that the applicant has been admitted to practice before and is a member in good standing of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States, or of the highest or appropriate court of any State or of the District of Columbia, or any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. A current court certificate is one executed within 90 calendar days preceding the date of the filing of the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Other Applicants:</em> An applicant, not an attorney at law, must file with the Admissions Clerk a completed application accompanied by a fee of $25. In addition, such an applicant, as a condition of being admitted to practice, must give evidence of the applicant's qualifications satisfactory to the Court by means of a written examination given by the Court, and the Court may require such person, in addition, to give similar evidence by means of an oral examination. Any person who has thrice failed to give such evidence by means of such written examination shall not thereafter be eligible to take another examination for admission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Application:</strong> An application for admission to practice before the Court must be on the form provided by the Court. Application forms and other necessary information will be furnished upon request addressed to the Admissions Clerk, United States Tax Court, 400 Second St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20217.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Sponsorship:</strong> An applicant for admission by examination must be sponsored by at least two persons theretofore admitted to practice before this Court, and each sponsor must send a letter of recommendation directly to the Admissions Clerk of the Court, where it will be treated as a confidential communication. The sponsor shall send this letter promptly after the applicant has been notified that he or she has passed the written examination required by paragraph (d). The sponsor shall state fully and frankly the extent of the sponsor's acquaintance with the applicant, the sponsor's opinion of the moral character and repute of the applicant, and the sponsor's opinion of the qualifications of the applicant to practice before this Court. The Court may in its discretion accept such an applicant with less than two such sponsors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Written Examinations:</strong> Written examinations, for applicants other than attorneys at law, will be held no less often than every two years. By public announcement at least six months prior to the date of the examination, the Court will announce the time and place of such examination. The Court will notify each applicant, whose application is in order, of the time and place at which the applicant is to be present for examination, and the applicant must present that notice to the examiner as authority for taking such an examination.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:38 --><p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Checks and Money Orders:</strong> Where the application fee is paid by check or money order, it shall be made payable to the order of the &ldquo;Clerk, United States Tax Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Admission:</strong> Upon approval of an application for admission and satisfaction of the other applicable requirements, an applicant will be admitted to practice before the Court upon taking and subscribing the oath or affirmation prescribed by the Court. Such an applicant shall thereupon be entitled to a certificate of admission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Change of Address:</strong> Each person admitted to practice before the Court shall promptly notify the Admissions Clerk of any change in office address for mailing purposes.

The frequency and amount of such fee shall be determined by the Court, except that such amount shall not exceed $30 per calendar year. The Clerk of the Court shall maintain an Ineligible List containing the names of all practitioners failing to comply with the provisions of this Rule. No practitioner shall be permitted to commence a case in the Court or enter an appearance in a pending case while on the Ineligible List. The name of any practitioner appearing on the Ineligible List shall not be removed from the List until the currently due registration fee has been paid and all arrearages have been made current. The periodic registration fee must be paid by all persons admitted to practice before the Court, whether or not engaged in private practice. As to forms of payment, see Rule 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The fees described in Rule 200(i)(1) shall be used by the Court to employ independent counsel to pursue disciplinary matters.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to such excess distribution, the taxpayer's gross income for the current year shall include (as ordinary income) only the amounts allocated under subparagraph (A) to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the current year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any period in the taxpayer's holding period before the 1st day of the 1st taxable year of the company which begins after December 31, 1986, and for which it was a passive foreign investment company, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the tax imposed by this chapter for the current year shall be increased by the deferred tax amount (determined under subsection (c)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dispositions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxpayer disposes of stock in a passive foreign investment company, then the rules of paragraph (1) shall apply to any gain recognized on such disposition in the same manner as if such gain were an excess distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1615 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Holding period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The taxpayer's holding period shall be determined under section 1223; except that, for purposes of applying this section to an excess distribution, such holding period shall be treated as ending on the date of such distribution.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;excess distribution&rdquo; means any distribution in respect of stock received during any taxable year to the extent such distribution does not exceed its ratable portion of the total excess distribution (if any) for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Total excess distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;total excess distribution&rdquo; means the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount of the distributions in respect of the stock received by the taxpayer during the taxable year, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 125 percent of the average amount received in respect of such stock by the taxpayer during the 3 preceding taxable years (or, if shorter, the portion of the taxpayer's holding period before the taxable year).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of clause (ii), any excess distribution received during such 3-year period shall be taken into account only to the extent it was included in gross income under subsection (a)(1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) No excess for 1st year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The total excess distributions with respect to any stock shall be zero for the taxable year in which the taxpayer's holding period in such stock begins.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) proper adjustments shall be made for stock splits and stock dividends,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the taxpayer does not hold the stock during the entire taxable year, distributions received during such year shall be annualized,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) if the taxpayer's holding period includes periods during which the stock was held by another person, distributions received by such other person shall be taken into account as if received by the taxpayer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) if the distributions are received in a foreign currency, determinations under this subsection shall be made in such currency and the amount of any excess distribution determined in such currency shall be translated into dollars,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) proper adjustment shall be made for amounts not includible in gross income by reason of section 551(d), 959(a), or 1293(c), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) if a charitable deduction was allowable under section 642(c) to a trust for any distribution of its income, proper adjustments shall be made for the deduction so allowable to the extent allocable to distributions or gain in respect of stock in a passive foreign investment company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deferred tax amount</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;deferred tax amount&rdquo; means, with respect to any distribution or disposition to which subsection (a) applies, an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the aggregate increases in taxes described in paragraph (2), plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the aggregate amount of interest (determined in the manner provided under paragraph (3)) on such increases in tax.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Any increase in the tax imposed by this chapter for the current year under subsection (a) to the extent attributable to the amount referred to in subparagraph (B) shall be treated as interest paid under section 6601 on the due date for the current year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Aggregate increases in taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the aggregate increases in taxes shall be determined by multiplying each amount allocated under subsection (a)(1)(A) to any taxable year (other than any taxable year referred to in subsection (a)(1)(B)) by the highest rate of tax in effect for such taxable year under section 1 or 11, whichever applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Computation of interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of interest referred to in paragraph (1)(B) on any increase determined under paragraph (2) for any taxable year shall be determined for the period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) beginning on the due date for such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) ending on the due date for the taxable year with or within which the distribution or disposition occurs,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall not apply with respect to any distribution paid by a passive foreign investment company, or any disposition of stock in a passive foreign investment company, if such company is a qualified electing fund with respect to the taxpayer for each of its taxable years&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1616 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which begins after December 31, 1986, and for which such company is a passive foreign investment company, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which includes any portion of the taxpayer's holding period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Election to recognize gain where company becomes qualified electing fund</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the taxpayer holds stock in such company on the first day of such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary the fair market value of such stock on such first day,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the taxpayer may elect to recognize gain as if he sold such stock on such first day for such fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional election for shareholder of controlled foreign corporations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the taxpayer holds stock in such company on the first day of such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) such company is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957(a)),</p>

The amount treated as a dividend under the preceding sentence shall be treated as an excess distribution and shall be allocated under subsection (a)(1)(A) only to days during periods taken into account in determining the post-1986 earnings and profits so attributable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that such excess distribution taxes are allocated to any other taxable year, such taxes shall reduce (subject to the principles of section 904(d) and not below zero) the increase in tax determined under subsection (c)(2) for such taxable year by reason of such distribution (but such taxes shall not be taken into account under section 901).</p>

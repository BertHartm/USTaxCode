<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such person has previously partially released or otherwise modified such a power and after the release or modification retains such control as would, within the principles of sections 671 to 677, inclusive, subject to grantor of a trust to treatment as the owner thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exception where grantor is taxable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to a power over income, as originally granted or <!-- PDFPage:1150 -->thereafter modified, if the grantor of the trust or a transferor (to whom section 679 applies) is otherwise treated as the owner under the provisions of this subpart other than this section.</p>

In cases where the amounts so applied or distributed are paid out of corpus or out of other than income of the taxable year, such amounts shall be considered to be an amount paid or credited within the meaning of paragraph (2) of section 661(a) and shall be taxed to the holder of the power under section 662.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect of renunciation or disclaimer</h4>

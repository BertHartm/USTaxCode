<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Taxable termination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this chapter, the term &ldquo;taxable termination&rdquo; means the termination (by death, lapse of time, release of power, or otherwise) of an interest in property held in a trust unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) immediately after such termination, a non-skip person has an interest in such property, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at no time after such termination may a distribution (including distributions on termination) be made from such trust to a skip person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain partial terminations treated as taxable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, upon the termination of an interest in property held in trust by reason of the death of a lineal descendant of the transferor, a specified portion of the trust's assets are distributed to 1 or more skip persons (or 1 or more trusts for the exclusive benefit of such persons), such termination shall constitute a taxable termination with respect to such portion of the trust property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taxable distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter, the term &ldquo;taxable distribution&rdquo; means any distribution from a trust to a skip person (other than a taxable termination or a direct skip).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Direct skip</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;direct skip&rdquo; means a transfer subject to a tax imposed by chapter 11 or 12 of an interest in property to a skip person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Look-thru rules not to apply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Solely for purposes of determining whether any transfer to a trust is a direct skip, the rules of section 2651(f)(2) shall not apply.</p>

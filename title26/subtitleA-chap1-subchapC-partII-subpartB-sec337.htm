<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain or loss shall be recognized to the liquidating corporation on the distribution to the 80-percent distributee of any property in a complete liquidation to which section 332 applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Treatment of indebtedness of subsidiary, etc.</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Indebtedness of subsidiary to parent</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a corporation is liquidated in a liquidation to which section 332 applies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the date of the adoption of the plan of liquidation, such corporation was indebted to the 80-percent distributee,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">for purposes of this section and section 336, any transfer of property to the 80-percent distributee in satisfaction of such indebtedness shall be treated as a distribution to such distributee in such liquidation.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), paragraph (1) and subsection (a) shall not apply where the 80-percent distributee is an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Later disposition or change in use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any property to which clause (i) applied is disposed of by the organization acquiring such property, notwithstanding any other provision of law, any gain (not in excess of the amount not recognized by reason of clause (i)) shall be included in such organization's unrelated business taxable income. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if such property ceases to be used in an activity referred to in clause (i), such organization shall be treated as having disposed of such property on the date of such cessation.</p>

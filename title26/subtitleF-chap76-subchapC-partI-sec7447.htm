<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recalling of retired judges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At or after his retirement, any individual who has elected to receive retired pay under subsection (d) may be called upon by the chief judge of the Tax Court to perform such judicial duties with the Tax Court as may be requested of him for any period or periods specified by the chief judge; except that in the case of any such individual&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) retires under paragraph (4) of subsection (b) and elects under subsection (e) to receive retired pay under this subsection shall receive retired pay during any period at a rate&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Such retired pay shall begin to accrue on the day following the day on which his salary as judge ceases to accrue, and shall continue to accrue during the remainder of his life. Retired pay under this subsection shall be paid in the same manner as the salary of a judge. In computing the rate of the retired pay under paragraph (1) of this subsection for any individual who is entitled thereto, that portion of the aggregate number of years he has served as a judge which is a fractional part of 1 year shall be eliminated if it is less than 6 months, or shall be counted as a full year if it is 6 months or more. In computing the rate of the retired pay under paragraph (1) of this subsection for any individual who is entitled thereto, any period during which such individual performs services under subsection (c) on a substantially full-time basis shall be treated as a period during which he has served as a judge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Election to receive retired pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any judge may elect to receive retired pay under subsection (d). Such an election&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) once made, shall be irrevocable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of any judge other than the chief judge, shall be made by filing notice thereof in writing with the chief judge; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2939 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of the chief judge, shall be made by filing notice thereof in writing with the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The chief judge shall transmit to the Office of Personnel Management a copy of each notice filed with him under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Retired pay affected in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual for whom an election to receive retired pay under subsection (d) is in effect&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) 1-year forfeiture for failure to perform judicial duties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If such individual during any calendar year fails to perform judicial duties required of him by subsection (c), such individual shall forfeit all rights to retired pay under subsection (d) for the 1-year period which begins on the 1st day on which he so fails to perform such duties.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If such individual accepts compensation for civil office or employment under the Government of the United States (other than the performance of judicial duties pursuant to subsection (c)), such individual shall forfeit all rights to retired pay under subsection (d) for the period for which such compensation is received.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Forfeitures of retired pay under paragraphs (1) and (2) not to apply where individual elects to freeze amount of retired pay</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any individual makes an election under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) paragraphs (1) and (2) (and subsection (c)) shall not apply to such individual beginning on the date such election takes effect, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the retired pay under subsection (d) payable to such individual for periods beginning on or after the date such election takes effect shall be equal to the retired pay to which such individual would be entitled without regard to this clause at the time of such election.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may be made by an individual only if such individual meets the age and service requirements for retirement under paragraph (2) of subsection (b),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may be made only during the period during which the individual may make an election to receive retired pay or while the individual is receiving retired pay, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall be made in the same manner as the election to receive retired pay.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Such an election, once it takes effect, shall be irrevocable.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) When election takes effect</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the provisions of the civil service retirement laws (including the provisions relating to the deduction and withholding of amounts from basic pay, salary, and compensation) shall apply in respect of service as a judge (together with other service as an officer or employee to whom such civil service retirement laws apply) as if this section had not been enacted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of electing retired pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any individual who has filed an election to receive retired pay under subsection (d)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no annuity or other payment shall be payable to any person under the civil service retirement laws with respect to any service performed by such individual (whether performed before or after such election is filed and whether performed as judge or otherwise);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no deduction for purposes of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund shall be made from retired pay payable to him under subsection (d) or from any other salary, pay, or compensation payable to him, for any period beginning after the day on which such election is filed; and</p>

If the chief judge retires for disability, his retirement shall not take effect until concurred in by the President. If any other judge retires for disability, he shall furnish to the President a certificate of disability signed by the chief judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever any judge who becomes permanently disabled from performing his duties does not retire and the President finds that such judge is unable to discharge efficiently all the duties of his office by reason of permanent mental or physical disability and that the appointment of an additional judge is necessary for the efficient dispatch of business, the President shall declare such judge to be retired.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2940 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Revocation of election to receive retired pay</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (e)(2), an individual who has filed an election to receive retired pay under subsection (d) may revoke such election at any time before the first day on which retired pay (or compensation under subsection (c) in lieu of retired pay) would (but for such revocation) begin to accrue with respect to such individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Manner of revoking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any revocation under this subsection shall be made by filing a notice thereof in writing with the Civil Service Commission. The Civil Service Commission shall transmit to the chief judge a copy of each notice filed under this subsection.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) no credit shall be allowed for any service as a judge of the Tax Court unless with respect to such service either there has been deducted and withheld the amount required by the civil service retirement laws or there has been deposited in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount equal to the amount so required, with interest,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Tax Court shall deposit in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount equal to the additional amount it would have contributed to such Fund but for the election under subsection (e), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) if subparagraph (D) is complied with, service on the Tax Court shall be treated as service with respect to which deductions and contributions had been made during the period of service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation&rdquo; means any foreign corporation (other than a foreign personal holding company or passive foreign investment company) if at <!-- PDFPage:584 -->least 10 percent of the stock of such corporation (by vote and value) is owned by the taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) U.S.-source portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the U.S.-source portion of any dividend is an amount which bears the same ratio to such dividend as&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any dividend received (directly or through a wholly owned foreign corporation) from a domestic corporation at least 80 percent of the stock of which (by vote and value) is owned (directly or through such wholly owned foreign corporation) by the qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the 1st day on which the requirements of paragraph (2) are met with respect to any foreign corporation is in a taxable year of such corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, the post-1986 undistributed earnings and the post-1986 undistributed U.S. earnings of such corporation shall be determined by only taking into account periods beginning on and after the 1st day of the 1st taxable year in which such requirements are met.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Coordination with subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Earnings and profits of any qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation for any taxable year shall not be taken into account under this subsection if the deduction provided by subsection (b) would be allowable with respect to dividends paid out of such earnings and profits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of section 904, the U.S.-source portion of any dividend received by a corporation from a qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation shall be treated as from sources in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any portion of a dividend received by a corporation from a qualified 10-percent-owned foreign corporation would be treated as from sources in the United States under paragraph (9),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the taxpayer chooses the benefits of this paragraph,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">this subsection shall not apply to such dividend (but subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section 904 and sections 902, 907, and 960 shall be applied separately with respect to such portion of such dividend).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for certain dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any dividend which is distributed out of earnings and profits attributable to foreign trade income which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is section 923(a)(2) nonexempt income (within the meaning of section 927(d)(6)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) would not, but for section 923(a)(4), be treated as exempt foreign trade income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No deduction under subsection (a) or (b)</h4>

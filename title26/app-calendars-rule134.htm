<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A case or matter scheduled on a calendar may be continued by the Court upon motion or at its own initiative. A motion for continuance shall inform the Court of the position of the other parties with respect thereto, either by endorsement thereon by the other parties or by a representation of the moving party. A motion for continuance based upon the pendency in a court of a related case or cases shall include the name and docket number of any such related case, the names of counsel for the parties in such case, and the status of such case, and shall identify all issues common to any such related case. Continuances will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. Conflicting engagements of counsel or employment of new counsel ordinarily will not be regarded as ground for continuance. A motion for continuance, filed 30 days or less prior to the date to which it is directed, may be set for hearing on that date, but ordinarily will be deemed dilatory and will be denied unless the ground therefor arose during that period or there was good reason for not making the motion sooner. As to extensions of time, see Rule 25(c).</p>

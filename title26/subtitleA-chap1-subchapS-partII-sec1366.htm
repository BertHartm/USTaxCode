<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If for the last taxable year of a corporation for which it was an S corporation a loss or deduction was disallowed by reason of paragraph (1), such loss or deduction shall be treated as incurred by the shareholder on the last day of any post-termination transition period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cannot exceed shareholder's basis in stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The aggregate amount of losses and deductions taken into account by a shareholder under subparagraph (A) shall not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder's stock in the corporation (determined at the close of the last day of the post-termination transition period and without regard to this paragraph).</p>

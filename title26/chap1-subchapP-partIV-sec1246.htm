<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Treatment of gain as ordinary income</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a sale or exchange (or a distribution which, under section 302 or 331, is treated as an exchange of stock) after December 31, 1962, of stock in a foreign corporation which was a foreign investment company (as defined in subsection (b)) at any time during the period during which the taxpayer held such stock, any gain shall be treated as ordinary income, to the extent of the taxpayer's ratable share of the earnings and profits of such corporation accumulated for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Ratable share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the taxpayer's ratable share shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, but shall include only his ratable share of the accumulated earnings and profits of such corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the period during which the taxpayer held such stock, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) excluding such earnings and profits attributable to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any amount previously included in the gross income of such taxpayer under section 951 (but only to the extent the inclusion of such amount did not result in an exclusion of any other amount from gross income under section 959), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any taxable year during which such corporation was not a foreign investment company but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such corporation was not a foreign investment company at any time before such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such corporation was treated as a foreign investment company solely by reason of subsection (b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Taxpayer to establish earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless the taxpayer establishes the amount of the accumulated earnings and profits of the foreign investment company and the ratable share thereof for the period during which the taxpayer held such stock, all the gain from the sale or exchange of stock in such company shall be considered as ordinary income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Holding period of stock must be more than 1 year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall not apply with respect to the sale or exchange of stock where the holding period of such stock as of the date of such sale or exchange is 1 year or less.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of foreign investment company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;foreign investment company&rdquo; means any foreign corporation which, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 to 80b&ndash;2), either as a management company or as a unit investment trust, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) engaged (or holding itself out as being engaged) primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) securities (as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) commodities, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any interest (including a futures or forward contract or option) in property described in subparagraph (A) or (B),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">at a time when 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or the total value of all classes of stock, was held directly (or indirectly through applying paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 958(a) and paragraph (4) of section 318(a)) by United States persons (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Stock having transferred or substituted basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, stock in a foreign corporation, the basis of which (in the hands of the taxpayer selling or exchanging such stock) is determined by reference to the basis (in the hands of such taxpayer or any other person) of stock in a foreign investment company, shall be treated <!-- PDFPage:1639 -->as stock of a foreign investment company and held by the taxpayer throughout the holding period for such stock (determined under section 1223).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rules relating to entities holding foreign investment company stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) trust certificates of a trust to which section 677 (relating to income for benefit of grantor) applies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) stock of a domestic corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be treated as stock of a foreign investment company and held by the taxpayer throughout the holding period for such certificates or stock (determined under section 1223) in the same proportion that the investment in stock in a foreign investment company by the trust or domestic corporation bears to the total assets of such trust or corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rules relating to stock acquired from a decedent</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of stock of a foreign investment company acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance (or by the decedent's estate) from a decedent dying after December 31, 1962, the basis determined under section 1014 shall be reduced (but not below the adjusted basis of such stock in the hands of the decedent immediately before his death) by the amount of the decedent's ratable share of the earnings and profits of such company accumulated after December 31, 1962. Any stock so acquired shall be treated as stock described in subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deduction for estate tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If stock to which subsection (a) applies is acquired from a decedent, the taxpayer shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, be allowed (for the taxable year of the sale or exchange) a deduction from gross income equal to that portion of the decedent's estate tax deemed paid which is attributable to the excess of (A) the value at which such stock was taken into account for purposes of determining the value of the decedent's gross estate, over (B) the value at which it would have been so taken into account if such value had been reduced by the amount described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Information with respect to certain foreign investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every United States person who, on the last day of the taxable year of a foreign investment company, owns 5 percent or more in value of the stock of such company shall furnish with respect to such company such information as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Coordination with section 1248</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to any gain to the extent such gain is treated as ordinary income under section 1248 (determined without regard to section 1248(g)(2)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Cross reference</h4>

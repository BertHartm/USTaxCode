<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of the tax determined under section 667(a), the interest charge is an amount equal to 6 percent of the partial tax computed under section 667(b) multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the numerator of which is the sum of the number of taxable years between each taxable year to which the distribution is allocated under section 666(a) and the taxable year of the distribution (counting in each case the taxable year to which the distribution is allocated but not counting the taxable year of the distribution), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the denominator of which is the number of taxable years to which the distribution is allocated under section 666(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total amount of the interest charge shall not, when added to the total partial tax computed under section 667(b), exceed the amount of the accumulation distribution (other than the amount of tax deemed distributed by section 666(b) or (c)) in respect of which such partial tax was determined.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interest charge not deductible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest charge determined under this section shall not be allowed as a deduction for purposes of any tax imposed by this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Coordination with amounts previously taxed under section 1248</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section and section 960(b), any amount included in the gross income of any person as a dividend by reason of subsection (a) or (f) of section 1248 shall be treated as an amount included in the gross income of such person (or, in any case to which section 1248(e) applies, of the domestic corporation referred to in section 1248(e)(2)) under section 951(a)(1)(A).</p>

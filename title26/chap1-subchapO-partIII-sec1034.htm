<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Nonrecognition of gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If property (in this section called &ldquo;old residence&rdquo;) used by the taxpayer as his principal residence is sold by him and, within a period beginning 2 years before the date of such sale and ending 2 years after such date, property (in this section called &ldquo;new residence&rdquo;) is purchased and used by the taxpayer as his principal residence, gain (if any) from such sale shall be recognized only to the extent that the taxpayer's adjusted sales price (as defined in subsection (b)) of the old residence exceeds the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjusted sales price defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;adjusted sales price&rdquo; means the amount realized, reduced by the aggregate of the expenses for work performed on the old residence in order to assist in its sale.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not taken into account in computing the amount realized from the sale of the old residence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules for application of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) An exchange by the taxpayer of his residence for other property shall be treated as a sale of such residence, and the acquisition of a residence on the exchange of property shall be treated as a purchase of such residence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A residence any part of which was constructed or reconstructed by the taxpayer shall be treated as purchased by the taxpayer. In determining the taxpayer's cost of purchasing a residence, there shall be included only so much of his cost as is attributable to the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and improvements made which are properly chargeable to capital account, during the period specified in subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If a residence is purchased by the taxpayer before the date of his sale of the old residence, the purchased residence shall not be treated as his new residence if sold or otherwise disposed of by him before the date of the sale of the old residence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the taxpayer, during the period described in subsection (a), purchases more than one residence which is used by him as his principal residence at some time within 2 years after the date of the sale of the old residence, only the last of such residences so used by him after the date of such sale shall constitute the new residence. If a principal residence is sold in a sale to which subsection (d)(2) applies within 2 years after the sale of the old residence, for purposes of applying the preceding sentence with respect to the old residence, the principal residence so sold shall be treated as the last residence used during such 2-year period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to the sale of the taxpayer's residence if within 2 years before the date of such sale the taxpayer sold at a gain other property used by him as his principal residence, and any part of such gain was not recognized by reason of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Subsequent sale connected with commencing work at new place</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the sale of the taxpayer's residence if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such sale was in connection with the commencement of work by the taxpayer as an employee or as a self-employed individual at a new principal place of work, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the residence so sold is treated as the former residence for purposes of section 217 (relating to moving expenses), the taxpayer would satisfy the conditions of subsection (c) of section 217 (as modified by the other subsections of such section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Basis of new residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the purchase of a new residence results, under subsection (a) or under section 112 (n) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, in the nonrecognition of gain on the sale of an old residence, in determining the adjusted basis of the new residence as of any time following the sale of the old residence, the adjustments to basis shall include a reduction by an amount equal to the amount of the gain not so recognized on the sale of the old residence. For this purpose, the amount of the gain not so recognized on the sale of the old residence includes only so much of such gain as is not recognized by reason of the cost, up to such time, of purchasing the new residence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, section 1016 (relating to adjustments to basis), and section 1223 (relating to holding period), references to property used by the taxpayer as his principal residence, and references to the residence of a taxpayer, shall include stock held by a tenant-stockholder (as defined in section 216, relating to deduction for amounts representing taxes and interest paid to a cooperative housing corporation) in a cooperative housing corporation (as defined in such section) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of stock sold, the house or apartment which the taxpayer was entitled to <!-- PDFPage:1569 -->occupy as such stockholder was used by him as his principal residence, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Husband and wife</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer and his spouse, in accordance with regulations which shall be prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection, consent to the application of paragraph (2) of this subsection, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the taxpayer's adjusted sales price of the old residence is the adjusted sales price (of the taxpayer, or of the taxpayer and his spouse) of the old residence, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence is the cost (to the taxpayer, his spouse, or both) of purchasing the new residence (whether held by the taxpayer, his spouse, or the taxpayer and his spouse); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) so much of the gain on the sale of the old residence as is not recognized solely by reason of this subsection, and so much of the adjustment under subsection (e) to the basis of the new residence as results solely from this subsection shall be allocated between the taxpayer and his spouse as provided in such regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This subsection shall apply only if the old residence and the new residence are each used by the taxpayer and his spouse as their principal residence.

For purposes of this subsection, except to the extent provided in regulations, in the case of an individual who dies after the date of the sale of the old residence and is married on the date of death, consent to the application of paragraph (2) by such individual's spouse and use of the new residence as the principal residence of such spouse shall be treated as consent and use by such individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Members of Armed Forces</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The running of any period of time specified in subsection (a) or (c) (other than the 2 years referred to in subsection (c)(4)) shall be suspended during any time that the taxpayer (or his spouse if the old residence and the new residence are each used by the taxpayer and his spouse as their principal residence) serves on extended active duty with the Armed Forces of the United States after the date of the sale of the old residence, except that any such period of time as so suspended shall not extend beyond the date 4 years after the date of the sale of the old residence.</p>

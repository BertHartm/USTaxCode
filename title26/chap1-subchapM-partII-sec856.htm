<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A real estate investment trust which meets the requirements of this paragraph at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a real estate investment trust because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A real estate investment trust which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a real estate investment trust if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;value&rdquo; means, with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith by the trustees, except that in the case of securities of real estate investment trusts such fair value shall not exceed market value or asset value, whichever is higher.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The term &ldquo;real estate assets&rdquo; means real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) and shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other real estate investment trusts which meet the requirements of this part. Such term also includes any property (not otherwise a real estate asset) attributable to the temporary investment of new capital, but only if such property is stock or a debt instrument, and only for the 1-year period beginning on the date the real estate trust receives such capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The term &ldquo;interests in real property&rdquo; includes fee ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon, leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, but does not include mineral, oil, or gas royalty interests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Qualified temporary investment income.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;qualified temporary investment income&rdquo; means any income which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is attributable to stock or a debt instrument (within the meaning of section 1275(a)(1)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is attributable to the temporary investment of new capital, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) is received or accrued during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the real estate investment trust receives such capital.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>New capital</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;new capital&rdquo; means any amount received by the real estate investment trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) in exchange for stock (or certificates of beneficial interests) in such trust (other than amounts received pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in a public offering of debt obligations of such trust which have maturities of at least 5 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset, and any amount includible in gross income with respect to such an interest shall be treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property; except that, if less than 95 percent of the assets of such REMIC are real estate assets (determined as if the real estate investment trust held such assets), such real estate investment trust shall be treated as holding directly (and as receiving directly) its proportionate share of the assets and income of the REMIC. For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any interest held by such REMIC in another REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that, if such REMIC's are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) All other terms shall have the same meaning as when used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 and following).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any gain from the sale or other disposition of such agreement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall be treated as income qualifying under paragraph (2) and such agreement shall be treated as a security for purposes of paragraph (4)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A corporation, trust, or association which fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or of both such paragraphs, for any taxable year shall nevertheless be considered to have satisfied the requirements of such paragraphs for such taxable year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature and amount of each item of its gross income described in such paragraphs is set forth in a schedule attached to its income tax return for such taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the inclusion of any incorrect information in the schedule referred to in subparagraph (A) is not due to fraud with intent to evade tax; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or of both such paragraphs, is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of liquidating gains</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of the taxable year in which a real estate investment trust is completely liquidated, there shall not be taken into account under paragraph (4) any gain from the sale, exchange, or distribution of any property after the adoption of the plan of complete liquidation.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (C), with respect to each lease of real property, rent attributable to personal property for the taxable year is that amount which bears the same ratio to total rent for the taxable year as the average of the adjusted bases of the personal property at the beginning and at the end of the taxable year bears to the average of the aggregate adjusted bases of both the real property and the personal property at the beginning and at the end of such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amounts excluded</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Subparagraph (C) shall not apply with respect to any amount if such amount would be excluded from unrelated business taxable income under section 512(b)(3) if received by an organization described in section 511(a)(2).</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1264 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for certain contingent rents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where a real estate investment trust receives or accrues, with respect to real or personal property, any amount which would be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; solely because the tenant of the real estate investment trust receives or accrues, directly or indirectly, from subtenants any amount the determination of which depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from such property, only a proportionate part (determined pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the amount received or accrued by the real estate investment trust from that tenant will be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Constructive ownership of stock</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then the amounts which the trust receives or accrues from the tenant shall not be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; by reason of being based on the income or profits of such tenant to the extent the amounts so received or accrued are attributable to qualified rents received or accrued by such tenant.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified rents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;qualified rents&rdquo; means any amount which would be treated as rents from real property if received by the real estate investment trust.</p>

Such term does not include property acquired by the real estate investment trust as a result of indebtedness arising from the sale or other disposition of property of the trust described in section 1221(1) which was not originally acquired as foreclosure property.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Extensions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the real estate investment trust establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that an extension of the grace period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of the trust's interests in such property, the Secretary may grant one or more extensions of the grace period for such property. Any such extension shall not extend the grace period beyond the date which is 6 years after the date such trust acquired such property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination of grace period in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any foreclosure property shall cease to be such on the first day (occurring on or after the day on which the real estate investment trust acquired the property) on which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a lease is entered into with respect to such property which, by its terms, will give rise to income which is not described in subsection (c)(3) (other than subparagraph (F) of such subsection), or any amount is received or accrued, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day which is not described in such subsection,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any construction takes place on such property (other than completion of a building, or completion of any other improvement, where more than 10 percent of the construction of such building or other improvement was completed before default became imminent), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if such day is more than 90 days after the day on which such property was acquired by the real estate investment trust and the property is used in a trade or business which is conducted by the trust (other than through an independent contractor (within the meaning of section (d)(3)) from whom the trust itself does not derive or receive any income).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Taxpayer must make election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Property shall be treated as foreclosure property for purposes of this part only if the real estate investment trust so elects (in the manner provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary) on or before the due date (including any extensions of time) for filing its return of tax under this chapter for the taxable year in which such trust acquires such property. Any such election shall be irrevocable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B) of subsection (c), the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo; does not <!-- PDFPage:1265 -->include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any amount so received or accrued shall not be excluded from the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo; solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) where a real estate investment trust receives any amount which would be excluded from the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo; solely because the debtor of the real estate investment trust receives or accrues any amount the determination of which depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, only a proportionate part (determined pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the amount received or accrued by the real estate investment trust from the debtor will be excluded from the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a real estate investment trust receives or accrues with respect to an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property or an interest in real property amounts from a debtor which derives substantially all of its gross income with respect to such property (not taking into account any gain on any disposition) from the leasing of substantially all of its interests in such property to tenants, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a portion of the amount which such debtor receives or accrues, directly or indirectly, from tenants consists of qualified rents (as defined in subsection (d)(6)(B)),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the amounts which the trust receives or accrues from such debtor shall not be excluded from the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo; by reason of being based on the income or profits of such debtor to the extent the amounts so received are attributable to qualified rents received or accrued by such debtor.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Failure to qualify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An election under subsection (c)(1) made by a corporation, trust, or association shall terminate if the corporation, trust, or association is not a real estate investment trust to which the provisions of this part apply for the taxable year with respect to which the election is made, or for any succeeding taxable year. Such termination shall be effective for the taxable year for which the corporation, trust, or association is not a real estate investment trust to which the provisions of this part apply, and for all succeeding taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An election under subsection (c)(1) made by a corporation, trust, or association may be revoked by it for any taxable year after the first taxable year for which the election is effective. A revocation under this paragraph shall be effective for the taxable year in which made and for all succeeding taxable years. Such revocation must be made on or before the 90th day after the first day of the first taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective. Such revocation shall be made in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe by regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Election after termination or revocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (4), if a corporation, trust, or association has made an election under subsection (c)(1) and such election has been terminated or revoked under paragraph (1) or paragraph (2), such corporation, trust, or association (and any successor corporation, trust, or association) shall not be eligible to make an election under subsection (c)(1) for any taxable year prior to the fifth taxable year which begins after the first taxable year for which such termination or revocation is effective.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the inclusion of any incorrect information in the return referred to in subparagraph (A) is not due to fraud with intent to evade tax; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the corporation, trust, or association establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that its failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust to which the provisions of this part apply is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.</p>

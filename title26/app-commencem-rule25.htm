If service is made by mail, then a period of time computed with respect to the service shall begin on the day after the date of mailing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays:</em> Saturdays, Sundays, and all legal holidays shall be counted, except that, (A) if the period prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, then intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in the District of Columbia shall be excluded in the computation; (B) if the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, then that day shall not be included and the period shall run until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or such a legal holiday; and (C) if any act is required to be taken or completed no later than (or at least) a specified number of days before a date certain, then the earliest day of the period so specified shall not be included if it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, and the earliest such day shall be the next preceding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or such a legal holiday. When such a legal holiday falls on a Sunday, the next day shall be considered a holiday; and, when such a legal holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding day shall be considered a holiday.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Cross-references:</em> For computation of the period within which to file a petition with the Court to redetermine a deficiency or liability, see Code Section 6213; for the period within which to file a petition in a declaratory judgment action, see Code Sections 7428, 7476, and 7478; for the period within which to file a petition in a disclosure action, see Code Section 6110; and for the period within which to file a petition in a partnership action, see Code Sections 6226 and 6228.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Enlargement or Reduction of Time:</strong> Unless precluded by statute, the Court in its discretion <!-- PDFPage:7 -->may make longer or shorter any period provided by these Rules. As to continuances, see Rule 134. Where a motion is made concerning jurisdiction or the sufficiency of a pleading, the time for filing a response to that pleading shall begin to run from the date of service of the order disposing of the motion by the Court, unless the Court shall direct otherwise. Where the dates for filing briefs are fixed, an extension of time for filing a brief or the granting of leave to file a brief after the due date shall correspondingly extend the time for filing any other brief due at the same time and for filing succeeding briefs, unless the Court shall order otherwise. The period fixed by statute, within which to file a petition with the Court to redetermine a deficiency or liability, cannot be extended by the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Miscellaneous:</strong> With respect to the computation of time, see also Rule 3(e) (definition), Rule 10(d) (business hours of the Court), Rule 13(c) (filing of petition), and Rule 134 (continuances).</p>

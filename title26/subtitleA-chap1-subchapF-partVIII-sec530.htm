<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An education individual retirement account shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions and special rules</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Education individual retirement account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;education individual retirement account&rdquo; means a trust created or organized in the United States exclusively for the purpose of paying the qualified higher education expenses of the designated beneficiary of the trust (and designated as an education individual retirement account at the time created or organized), but only if the written governing instrument creating the trust meets the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) No contribution will be accepted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) unless it is in cash,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) after the date on which such beneficiary attains age 18, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) except in the case of rollover contributions, if such contribution would result in aggregate contributions for the taxable year exceeding $500.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The trustee is a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) or another person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the manner in which that person will administer the trust will be consistent with the requirements of this section or who has so demonstrated with respect to any individual retirement plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) No part of the trust assets will be invested in life insurance contracts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The assets of the trust shall not be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund or common investment fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such term shall include amounts paid or incurred to purchase tuition credits or certificates, or to make contributions to an account, under a qualified State tuition program (as defined in section 529(b)) for the benefit of the beneficiary of the account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Eligible educational institution</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The maximum amount which a contributor could otherwise make to an account under this section shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to such maximum amount as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the contributor's modified adjusted gross income for such taxable year, over</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the distribution of any contribution made during a taxable year on behalf of a designated beneficiary to the extent that such contribution exceeds $500 if&mdash;</p>

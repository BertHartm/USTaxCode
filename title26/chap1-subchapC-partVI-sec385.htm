<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to prescribe regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to determine whether an interest in a corporation is to be treated for purposes of this title as stock or indebtedness (or as in part stock and in part indebtedness).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The regulations prescribed under this section shall set forth factors which are to be taken into account in determining with respect to a particular factual situation whether a debtor-creditor relationship exists or a corporation-shareholder relationship exists. The factors so set forth in the regulations may include among other factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether there is a written unconditional promise to pay on demand or on a specified date a sum certain in money in return for an adequate consideration in money or money's worth, and to pay a fixed rate of interest,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether there is subordination to or preference over any indebtedness of the corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the ratio of debt to equity of the corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether there is convertibility into the stock of the corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the relationship between holdings of stock in the corporation and holdings of the interest in question.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effect of classification by issuer</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The characterization (as of the time of issuance) by the issuer as to whether an interest in a corporation is stock or indebtedness shall be binding on such issuer and on all holders of such interest (but shall not be binding on the Secretary).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notification of inconsistent treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in regulations, paragraph (1) shall not apply to any holder of an interest <!-- PDFPage:749 -->if such holder on his return discloses that he is treating such interest in a manner inconsistent with the characterization referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary is authorized to require such information as the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.</p>

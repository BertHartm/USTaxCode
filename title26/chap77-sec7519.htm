<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section applies to a partnership or S corporation for any taxable year, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an election under section 444 is in effect for the taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the required payment determined under subsection (b) for such taxable year (or any preceding taxable year) exceeds $500.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;required payment&rdquo; means, with respect to any applicable election year of a partnership or S corporation, an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the excess of the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the applicable percentage of the adjusted highest section 1 rate, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the net base year income of the entity, over</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the net required payment balance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the term &ldquo;adjusted highest section 1 rate&rdquo; means the highest rate of tax in effect under section 1 as of the end of the base year plus 1 percentage point (or, in the case of applicable election years beginning in 1987, 36 percent).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Refund of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, for any applicable election year, the amount determined under subsection (b)(2) exceeds the amount determined under subsection (b)(1), the entity shall be entitled to a refund of such excess for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination of elections, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an election under section 444 is terminated effective with respect to any year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the entity is liquidated during any year, the entity shall be entitled to a refund of the net required payment balance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Date on which refund payable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any refund under this subsection shall be payable on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) April 15 of the calendar year following&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of the year referred to in paragraph (1), the calendar year in which it begins,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of the year referred to in paragraph (2), the calendar year in which it ends, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the day 90 days after the day on which claim therefor is filed with the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Net base year income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An entity's net base year income shall be equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the deferral ratio multiplied by the entity's net income for the base year, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the deferral ratio multiplied by the aggregate amount of applicable payments made by the entity during the base year, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the aggregate amount of such applicable payments made during the deferral period of the base year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;deferral ratio&rdquo; means the ratio which the number of months in the deferral period of the base year bears to the number of months in the partnership's or S corporation's taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Net income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Net income is determined by taking into account the aggregate amount of the following items&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Partnerships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a partnership, net income shall be the amount (not below zero) determined by taking into account the aggregate amount of the partnership's items described in section 702(a) (other than credits and tax-exempt income).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) S corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an S corporation, net income shall be the amount (not below zero) determined by taking into account the aggregate amount of the S corporation's items described in section 1366(a) (other than credits and tax-exempt income). If the S corporation was a C corporation for the base year, its taxable income for such year shall be treated as its net income for such year (and such corporation shall be treated as an S corporation for such taxable year for purposes of paragraph (3)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain limitations disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A) or (B), any limitation on the amount of any item described in either such paragraph which may be taken into account for purposes of computing the taxable income of a partner or shareholder shall be disregarded.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicable payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;applicable payment&rdquo; means amounts paid by a partnership or S corporation which are includible in gross income of a partner or shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;applicable payment&rdquo; shall not include any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) gain from the sale or exchange of property between the partner or shareholder and the partnership or S corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) dividend paid by the S corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicable percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The applicable percentage is the percentage determined in accordance with the following table:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, the applicable percentage for any partnership or S corporation shall be 100 percent unless more than 50 percent of such entity's net income for the short taxable year which would have resulted if the entity had not made an election under section 444 would have been allocated to partners or shareholders who would have been entitled to the benefits of section 806(e)(2)(C) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 with respect to such income.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (h), this section applies to a plan if, for any plan year beginning on or after the effective date of this section for such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such plan included a trust which qualified (or was determined by the Secretary to have qualified) under section 401(a), or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:875 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such plan satisfied (or was determined by the Secretary to have satisfied) the requirements of section 403(a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A plan to which this section applies shall have satisfied the minimum funding standard for such plan for a plan year if as of the end of such plan year, the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency. For purposes of this section and section 4971, the term &ldquo;accumulated funding deficiency&rdquo; means for any plan the excess of the total charges to the funding standard account for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year to which this section applies) over the total credits to such account for such years or, if less, the excess of the total charges to the alternative minimum funding standard account for such plan years over the total credits to such account for such years. In any plan year in which a multiemployer plan is in reorganization, the accumulated funding deficiency of the plan shall be determined under section 418B.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding standard account</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Account required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each plan to which this section applies shall establish and maintain a funding standard account. Such account shall be credited and charged solely as provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charges to account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the normal cost of the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amounts necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this section applies, over a period of 40 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a plan which comes into existence after January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this section applies, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net increase (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience loss (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net loss (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of subsection (d)(3)) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years any amount credited to the funding standard account under paragraph (3)(D).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For additional requirements in the case of plans other than multiemployer plans, see subsection (<em>l</em>).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Credits to account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net decrease (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net gain (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of the waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of subsection (d)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#412_1_target" name="412_1">1</a></sup> for the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standards, the excess (if any) of any debit balance in the funding standard account (determined without regard to this subparagraph) over any debit balance in the alternative minimum funding standard account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Combining and offsetting amounts to be amortized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, amounts required to be amortized under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3), as the case may be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may be combined into one amount under such paragraph to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization period for all items entering into such combined amount, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may be offset against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:876 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Required change of interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining a plan's current liability and for purposes of determining a plan's required contribution under section 412(<em>l</em>) for any plan year&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any rate of interest used under the plan to determine cost is not within the permissible range, the plan shall establish a new rate of interest within the permissible range.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Permissible range</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Except as provided in subclause (II), the term &ldquo;permissible range&rdquo; means a rate of interest which is not more than 10 percent above, and not more than 10 percent below, the weighted average of the rates of interest on 30-year Treasury securities during the 4-year period ending on the last day before the beginning of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Secretarial authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">If the Secretary finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) is unreasonably high, the Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate determined under subclause (I).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding subsection (c)(3)(A)(i), the interest rate used under the plan shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Certain amortization charges and credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a plan which, immediately before the date of the enactment of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, was a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of section 414(f) as in effect immediately before such date)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(iii), or (3)(B)(i) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) or (3)(B)(ii) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 20 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 3 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from a plan amendment adopted before such date, shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the change arises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 2 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from the changing of a group of participants from one benefit level to another benefit level under a schedule of plan benefits which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was adopted before such date, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was effective for any plan participant before the beginning of the first plan year beginning on or after such date,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the change arises.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rules for multiemployer plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Withdrawal liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan's funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustments when a multiemployer plan leaves reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a multiemployer plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 418B(a) as of the end of the last plan year that the plan was in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Plan payments to supplemental program or withdrawal liability payment fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid by a plan during a plan year to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Cor<!-- PDFPage:877 -->poration pursuant to section 4222 of such Act or to a fund exempt under section 501(c)(22) pursuant to section 4223 of such Act shall reduce the amount of contributions considered received by the plan for the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Interim withdrawal liability payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of such Act and subsequently refunded to the employer by the plan shall be charged to the funding standard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) For purposes of the full funding limitation under subsection (c)(7), unless otherwise provided by the plan, the accrued liability under a multiemployer plan shall not include benefits which are not nonforfeitable under the plan after the termination of the plan (taking into consideration section 411(d)(3)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determinations to be made under funding method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Valuation of assets</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, the value of the plan's assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election with respect to bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The value of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is not in default as to principal or interest may, at the election of the plan administrator, be determined on an amortized basis running from initial cost at purchase to par value at maturity or earliest call date. Any election under this subparagraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations provide, shall apply to all such evidences of indebtedness, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary. In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, this subparagraph shall not apply, but the Secretary may by regulations provide that the value of any dedicated bond portfolio of such plan shall be determined by using the interest rate under subsection (b)(5).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Actuarial assumptions must be reasonable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, all costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a plan other than a multiemployer plan, each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) or which, in the aggregate, result in a total contribution equivalent to that which would be determined if each such assumption and method were reasonable, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a multiemployer plan, which, in the aggregate, are reasonable (taking into account the experiences of the plan and reasonable expectations), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of certain changes as experience gain or loss</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a change in the definition of the term &ldquo;wages&rdquo; under section 3121, or a change in the amount of such wages taken into account under regulations prescribed for purposes of section 401(a)(5),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Change in funding method or in plan year requires approval</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the funding method for a plan is changed, the new funding method shall become the funding method used to determine costs and liabilities under the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary. If the plan year for a plan is changed, the new plan year shall become the plan year for the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Approval required for certain changes in assumptions by certain single-employer plans subject to additional funding requirement</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No actuarial assumption (other than the assumptions described in subsection (<em>l</em>)(7)(C)) used to determine the current liability for a plan to which this subparagraph applies may be changed without the approval of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Plans to which subparagraph applies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This subparagraph shall apply to a plan only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the plan is a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) to which title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 applies;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the change in assumptions (determined after taking into account any changes in interest rate and mortality table) results in a decrease in the unfunded current liability of the plan for the current plan year that exceeds $50,000,000, or that exceeds $5,000,000 and that is 5 percent or more of the current liability of the plan before such change.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Full funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, as of the close of a plan year, a plan would (without regard to this paragraph) have an accumulated funding deficiency (determined without regard to the alternative minimum funding standard account permitted under subsection (g)) in excess of the full funding limitation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the funding standard account shall be credited with the amount of such excess, and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Minimum amount</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In no event shall the full-funding limitation determined under subparagraph (A) be less than the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 90 percent of the current liability of the plan (including the expected increase in current liability due to benefits accruing during the plan year), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the value of the plan's assets determined under paragraph (2).</p>

No amendment described in this subsection shall be approved by the Secretary of Labor unless he determines that such amendment is necessary because of a substantial business hardship (as determined under subsection (d)(2)) and that a waiver under subsection (d)(1) is unavailable or inadequate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an employer or in the case of a multiemployer plan, 10 percent or more of the number of employers contributing to or under the plan, are unable to satisfy the minimum funding standard for a plan year without temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan) and if application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate, the Secretary may waive the requirements of subsection (a) for such year with respect to all or any portion of the minimum funding standard other than the portion thereof determined under subsection (b)(2)(C). The Secretary shall not waive the minimum funding standard with respect to a plan for more than 3 of any 15 (5 of any 15 in the case of a multiemployer plan) consecutive plan years. The interest rate used for purposes of computing the amortization charge described in subsection (b)(2)(C) for any plan year shall be&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there is substantial unemployment or underemployment in the trade or business and in the industry concerned,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the sales and profits of the industry concerned are depressed or declining, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) it is reasonable to expect that the plan will be continued only if the waiver is granted.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary may provide that an analysis of a trade or business or industry of a member need not be conducted if the Secretary determines such analysis is not necessary because the taking into account of such member would not significantly affect the determination under this subsection.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6013. Joint returns of income tax by husband and wife</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Joint returns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A husband and wife may make a single return jointly of income taxes under subtitle A, even though one of the spouses has neither gross income nor deductions, except as provided below:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no joint return shall be made if either the husband or wife at any time during the taxable year is a nonresident alien;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no joint return shall be made if the husband and wife have different taxable years; except that if such taxable years begin on the same day and end on different days because of the death of either or both, then the joint return may be made with respect to the taxable <!-- PDFPage:2305 -->year of each. The above exception shall not apply if the surviving spouse remarries before the close of his taxable year, nor if the taxable year of either spouse is a fractional part of a year under section 443(a)(1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of death of one spouse or both spouses the joint return with respect to the decedent may be made only by his executor or administrator; except that in the case of the death of one spouse the joint return may be made by the surviving spouse with respect to both himself and the decedent if no return for the taxable year has been made by the decedent, no executor or administrator has been appointed, and no executor or administrator is appointed before the last day prescribed by law for filing the return of the surviving spouse. If an executor or administrator of the decedent is appointed after the making of the joint return by the surviving spouse, the executor or administrator may disaffirm such joint return by making, within 1 year after the last day prescribed by law for filing the return of the surviving spouse, a separate return for the taxable year of the decedent with respect to which the joint return was made, in which case the return made by the survivor shall constitute his separate return.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Joint return after filing separate return</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), if an individual has filed a separate return for a taxable year for which a joint return could have been made by him and his spouse under subsection (a) and the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year has expired, such individual and his spouse may nevertheless make a joint return for such taxable year. A joint return filed by the husband and wife under this subsection shall constitute the return of the husband and wife for such taxable year, and all payments, credits, refunds, or other repayments made or allowed with respect to the separate return of either spouse for such taxable year shall be taken into account in determining the extent to which the tax based upon the joint return has been paid. If a joint return is made under this subsection, any election (other than the election to file a separate return) made by either spouse in his separate return for such taxable year with respect to the treatment of any income, deduction, or credit of such spouse shall not be changed in the making of the joint return where such election would have been irrevocable if the joint return had not been made. If a joint return is made under this subsection after the death of either spouse, such return with respect to the decedent can be made only by his executor or administrator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations for making of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The election provided for in paragraph (1) may not be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) unless there is paid in full at or before the time of the filing of the joint return the amount shown as tax upon such joint return; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) after the expiration of 3 years from the last date prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (determined without regard to any extension of time granted to either spouse); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) after there has been mailed to either spouse, with respect to such taxable year, a notice of deficiency under section 6212, if the spouse, as to such notice, files a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in section 6213; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) after either spouse has commenced a suit in any court for the recovery of any part of the tax for such taxable year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) after either spouse has entered into a closing agreement under section 7121 with respect to such taxable year, or after any civil or criminal case arising against either spouse with respect to such taxable year has been compromised under section 7122.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) When return deemed filed</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Assessment and collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 6501 (relating to periods of limitations on assessment and collection), and for purposes of section 6651 (relating to delinquent returns), a joint return made under this subsection shall be deemed to have been filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Where both spouses filed separate returns prior to making the joint return&mdash;on the date the last separate return was filed (but not earlier than the last date prescribed by law for filing the return of either spouse);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Where only one spouse filed a separate return prior to the making of the joint return, and the other spouse had less than the exemption amount of gross income for such taxable year&mdash;on the date of the filing of such separate return (but not earlier than the last date prescribed by law for the filing of such separate return); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Where only one spouse filed a separate return prior to the making of the joint return, and the other spouse had gross income of the exemption amount or more for such taxable year&mdash;on the date of the filing of such joint return.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;exemption amount&rdquo; has the meaning given to such term by section 151(d). For purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii), if the spouse whose gross income is being compared to the exemption amount is 65 or over, such clauses shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;the sum of the exemption amount and the additional standard deduction under section 63(c)(2) by reason of section 63(f)(1)(A)&rdquo; for &ldquo;the exemption amount&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Credit or refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 6511, a joint return made under this subsection shall be deemed to have been filed on the last date prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (determined without regard to any extension of time granted to either spouse).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional time for assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a joint return is made under this subsection, the periods of limitations provided in sections 6501 and 6502 on the making of assess<!-- PDFPage:2306 -->ments and the beginning of levy or a proceeding in court for collection shall with respect to such return include one year immediately after the date of the filing of such joint return (computed without regard to the provisions of paragraph (3)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Additions to the tax and penalties</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Coordination with part II of subchapter A of chapter 68</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of part II of subchapter A of chapter 68, where the sum of the amounts shown as tax on the separate returns of each spouse is less than the amount shown as tax on the joint return made under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such sum shall be treated as the amount shown on the joint return,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any negligence (or disregard of rules or regulations) on either separate return shall be treated as negligence (or such disregard) on the joint return, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any fraud on either separate return shall be treated as fraud on the joint return.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Criminal penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 7206(1) and (2) and section 7207 (relating to criminal penalties in the case of fraudulent returns) the term &ldquo;return&rdquo; includes a separate return filed by a spouse with respect to a taxable year for which a joint return is made under this subsection after the filing of such separate return.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of joint return after death of either spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of sections 15, 443, and 7851(a)(1)(A), where the husband and wife have different taxable years because of the death of either spouse, the joint return shall be treated as if the taxable years of both spouses ended on the date of the closing of the surviving spouse's taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the status as husband and wife of two individuals having taxable years beginning on the same day shall be determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if both have the same taxable year&mdash;as of the close of such year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if one dies before the close of the taxable year of the other&mdash;as of the time of such death;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an individual who is legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance shall not be considered as married; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if a joint return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate income and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Spouse relieved of liability in certain cases</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a joint return has been made under this section for a taxable year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on such return there is a substantial understatement of tax attributable to grossly erroneous items of one spouse,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the other spouse establishes that in signing the return he or she did not know, and had no reason to know, that there was such substantial understatement, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it is inequitable to hold the other spouse liable for the deficiency in tax for such taxable year attributable to such substantial understatement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the other spouse shall be relieved of liability for tax (including interest, penalties, and other amounts) for such taxable year to the extent such liability is attributable to such substantial understatement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Grossly erroneous items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;grossly erroneous items&rdquo; means, with respect to any spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any item of gross income attributable to such spouse which is omitted from gross income, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any claim of a deduction, credit, or basis by such spouse in an amount for which there is no basis in fact or law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Substantial understatement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;substantial understatement&rdquo; means any understatement (as defined in section 6662(d)(2)(A)) which exceeds $500.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Understatement must exceed specified percentage of spouse's income</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Adjusted gross income of $20,000 or less</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the spouse's adjusted gross income for the preadjustment year is $20,000 or less, this subsection shall apply only if the liability described in paragraph (1) is greater than 10 percent of such adjusted gross income.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjusted gross income of more than $20,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the spouse's adjusted gross income for the preadjustment year is more than $20,000, subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;25 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;10 percent&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Preadjustment year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;preadjustment year&rdquo; means the most recent taxable year of the spouse ending before the date the deficiency notice is mailed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Computation of spouse's adjusted gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the spouse is married to another spouse at the close of the preadjustment year, the spouse's adjusted gross income shall include the income of the new spouse (whether or not they file a joint return).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Exception for omissions from gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not apply to any liability attributable to the omission of an item from gross income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special rule for community property income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the determination of the spouse to whom items of gross income (other than gross income from prop<!-- PDFPage:2307 -->erty) are attributable shall be made without regard to community property laws.</p>
